Codio is best experienced on the very latest browsers, in particular Chrome, but should run fine on the following browsers:

- **Chrome** 21 or later
- **Firefox** - 22 or later
- **IE** - 10 or later
- **Safari** - 6 or later
- **Opera** - 15 or later


If you are experiencing any issue where Codio will not run and the above list says it should, then either Tweet [@CodioHQ](https://twitter.com/codiohq) or send an email to support@codio.com.

## Disable IE Compatibility View

It could happen that even if you have Internet Explorer 10 or Later, we detect a older version of the browser.
This is due to the *Compatibility Mode* of the Browser which enables old features we no longer support.

To disable this option, please go to ***Tools → F12 developer tools*** and be sure that in **Browser Mode** is selected **«Internet Explorer 10»** and in **Document Mode** is selected **«Standards (Page default)»**.

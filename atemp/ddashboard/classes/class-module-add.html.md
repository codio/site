## Searching for Courses and Modules
The Course browser will open for you to search for the course and module(s) you wish to add.

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

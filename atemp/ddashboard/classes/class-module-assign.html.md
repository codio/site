### Students View
Once your class is set up, your students can start working.

The student can access the modules by going to the the My Classroom menu item in the dashboard. They can select the appropriate class and then they will see all the modules for that class. 

They can then open up the module to see the units and from there can then open project in the IDE by pressing the 'ready to go' button.

This will fork the project into the students Codio account and will also be accessible to them from their recently used area at the top of their My Classroom area. If they navigate to the Class/Course, they will see 'in progress' indicating they have already started the unit.

### Managing your Class

**Units tab**

Teachers are able to see the students who have started units on the `Units` tab.

If the counter in the `Students Started` column is blank, none of the students have yet assigned themselves the units, but otherwise the teacher can see how many students have started the unit, and clicking on that column will show more details.


![Student Progress](/img/docs/trial_try_unit.png)

Teachers can enable/disable and pin units here :

1. Any units that are disabled will not be accessible by your students, either to Start a new unit or if they have already started the unit in the past, from their My Classroom area. 
1. Teachers are still able to view the Students Unit if required. This can be useful if running a Controlled Assessment in  classes or if authoring your own content and wish to check it out within the class yourself first.
1. Units that are pinned will show as 'Starred' for the students in their recently used area.

Teachers can also open the unit as a 'Teacher' to access the [Teacher Solutions](/docs/teacher/special/tsolutions/).

**Students tab**

![Student Remove](/img/docs/class_studentstab.png)

Teachers can remove students from the class and if students do not have access to the email account used to create their Codio account, also change/reset their account password.

Each class needs at least one teacher and can be added as required.

Teachers can

- modify class properties
- delete the class
- access student code from the class listing
- assign grades and comments to each student module assignment (coming soon)
- enable/disable units within courses

If you are the teacher of the class, you should always add yourself as a teacher, even if you are the organization owner. You can also add others as teachers to the class. 

Teachers are able to view student projects from the student listing within the class. They can also assign modules.

1. Go to your class.
1. Click on the **Admin** tab at the top of the listing.
1. Click the **Edit** button to enable the **Add Teacher** dialog, click this and the 'Add a Teacher' dialog will pop up.
1. This list will show all Codio users within your organization if you enable the 'Filter by organisation' option, but if that person is not already a member of your organisation but is a Codio user, deselect this option to search for their Codio username. Do though be sure to select the right person. You can type in the field to search or you can scroll through the list. Once you have found the right person, click on that person or press enter with the correct name highlighted.

The teacher is now added to the list of teachers.

You can remove teachers by clicking `Edit` and then the **X** button next to their name.

It can happen that after you create your module you make some changes to the original module by modifying the source Codio projects. If this happens, you will not see these changes reflected in the class modules.

Only Module owners or those with administration permissions may modify units.

You can edit the source Codio project by opening it from your normal Codio projects list. Alternatively, if you are viewing the Unit in the Modules/Courses list, you can open it by clicking on Module, enable the 'Edit Units' toggle button and then the select the unit and press the `Edit Original` button.

From the same screen, click the `Refresh Source` button to update the unit from the source project.

This updates the module units but it does not update the class module, as these are copies. To update the class from the module, enable the 'Edit Units' toggle button and press the 'Refresh Source' button (circled below) for the required module(s)

##Active Classes with Students already completing Units
If you refresh the source, any students who have already started working on those units will not see the changes. They will need to fork the project again to see the changes

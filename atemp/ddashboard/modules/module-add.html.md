Only Module owners or those with administration permissions for the module can add units. Please refer to the [Create a new Module](/docs/dashboard/modules/module-create/) section for information on permissions and collaborators.

A Module unit is simply a Codio project that contains

- a code workspace and files
- a [Codio Guide](/docs/dashboard/modules/guides)

Enable the 'Edit Units' toggle button and then press the `Add Unit` button to add a new unit.

##Add Details
Add a description and, importantly, a good description of the project that is helpful to others browsing Module and unit content.

##Select the Source
You should select the Codio Project that the unit is taken from. 

Once you have chosen a source for your unit, a snapshot is made and is stored in a separate storage location. Any modifications you make to your source Project will not be reflected in the unit unless you refresh it. 

##Refreshing the unit from the source Project
If you do make changes to your source Project and you want these to be reflected in the Module unit, you will need to select the unit and then press the `Refresh Source` button.

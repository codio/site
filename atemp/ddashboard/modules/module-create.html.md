Before you create a Module, you should have prepared at least one Codio Project that is ready to add as a unit. Please make sure you have read the [Guides](/docs/tuts/author/) documentation as a unit requires a Guide.

To create a new Module, press the 'New Module' button in the top right of then screen on the main Modules screen.

##Name, Descriptions, Image & Tags
You are required to enter a name for your module. The Short Description is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.

A Long Description is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your Module.

You should also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image is also suggested.

##Visibility
This determines whether your Module and its constituent Units are publicly available to all Codio users or should remain private to you and/or your [Organization](/docs/dashboard/organizations/) (if you are a member of an Organization). Private Modules require a paid subscription.

##Owner
By default, you are the owner of the Module you create. If you select an Organization from the dropdown, then any Owner group members of that Organization are able to adminster the Module and all Organization members will be able to see it in the listing, even if the Module is marked as private.

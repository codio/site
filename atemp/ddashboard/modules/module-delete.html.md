##Delete a Unit
You can delete a unit by enabling the 'Edit Units' toggle button and then pressing the `Delete` button, or access the Unit and delete there. See:

##Delete a Module
You can delete a Module by selecting the Module from the listing, then press the `Delete` button.


If you delete a Module or a unit, any Modules that have been assigned to a Class will remain intact for the lifetime of that class.

The `Modules` menu item can be found in the left menu area of the Codio dashboard beneath the 'Courses' menu item.

Modules are a great way of grouping and ordering resources so students can find and access them in one place.

Let's say you wanted to create a module 'An Introduction to Javascript'. You would first create several Codio projects to cover different Javascript topics. These resources should include a [Codio Guide](/docs/dashboard/modules/guides/).

In the Modules section, you would then create a Module called 'An Introduction to Javascript' and then add them into that Module. Students can then find it from the main Modules listing and work their way through each module.

When they select a Module unit, it will fork it and create a Project in their own account. They are free to run it, modify the code and follow the [Codio Guide](/docs/dashboard/modules/guides/).

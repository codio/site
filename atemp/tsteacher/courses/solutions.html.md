Codio content has a special feature that allows the content author to write solutions or any other types of content that should be seen by the teacher only. Students will not see this content.

All Codio courses have teacher solutions for almost every challenge so they have instant access to the solution when they need it, all within the same content that the student is seeing.

No more having to dig around for solutions to simple or complex challenges.

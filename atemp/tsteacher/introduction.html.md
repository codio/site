Codio is the cloud coding and course content platform for teaching computer science in schools, universities and the self-learner / vocational sector.  Educators worldwide are using Codio – from primary years (KS2 years 5 and 6 in the UK, grades 3-12 in the US system), through to colleges and universities in higher education.

As Computing and Computer Science take an increasingly prominent role in education systems worldwide, teachers, educators and technicians face the complex challenges of classroom technology, student access on personal devices, software configuration and the need to present an integrated learning environment where students can 'learn by doing'.

Codio solves these problems and delivers breakthrough benefits for schools and universities in the following ways:

-	setting up your institution, creating user groups and classes, is easy. Please [refer to this section](/docs/teacher/trial/) for information on how to get the most out of a Codio trial.
-	we’ve collaborated with leading UK exam board – OCR (Oxford, Cambridge & RSA) to bring you curriculum-mapped teaching resources integrated within the Codio platform using Codio’s [Guides](/docs/tuts/) authoring and publishing tools;
-	teaching content sits alongside live code files and the preview window creating a significantly more engaging learning experience and allowing you to play a far more facilitative, coaching and supporting role;
-	courses are brought to life with challenges and assessments that are auto-marked and populate in your teacher dashboard allowing you to track and demonstrate student progress at every stage;
-   course resources contain teacher-only solutions notes, and Codio offers a range of webinar support sessions giving you regular access to experts to support your teaching plans;
-   there's no software to install on classroom machines, nor on student machines; Codio comes pre-configured with all the software languages, frameworks and databases you’ll need;
-   as a cloud platform, students can access course resources & programming projects from anywhere using just a browser.  Use school machines in the classroom and continue on your personal devices at home;
-	each user gets all the project workspace, storage and processing you need;
-   creating projects is easy using Codio's [Stacks](/docs/teacher/special/stacks/) and [Starter Packs](/docs/teacher/special/packs/) - an extensive library of pre-configured environments including software languages, databases and components.

Codio offers a 3 level hierarchy for organising and publishing course materials. 

- A [Course](/docs/tuts/publish/overview) is the top level and consists of a collection of Modules.
- A [Module](/docs/dashboard/modules/) will typically incorporate all the course materials to cover a logical area of a curriculum or coursework. It in turn consists of a collection of Units.
- A [Unit](/docs/dashboard/modules/module-add) is the lowest level item of coursework. It will typically contain enough material to cover a particular topic or area of a curriculum or coursework.

Take a look at the '[Schools Computing Curriculum](https://codio.com/home/courses/557540466201adf25c93ccec/?tab=modules)' Course and you can see its associated Modules and, within each Module, the Units.

You can create your own Courses, Modules and Units if you wish. You will need to familiarise yourself with [Codio Guides](/docs/tuts/) to author your own tutorial content and assessments and challenges. 

A [Module](/docs/dashboard/modules/) is a collection of teaching resources that have been grouped and ordered. It is an ideal way of giving students access to a coherent set of Projects aimed at teaching any coding topic you like.

When combined with [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classes/), you get a powerful way of teaching a class of students that let's you organize, review student code and grade.

## Codio Guides
Anyone creating a Module should utilise [Codio Guides](/docs/tuts/), a rich content authoring tool for publishing content that allows students to view instructions while they edit their code.

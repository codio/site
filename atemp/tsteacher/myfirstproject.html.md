Codio lets you create your own coding projects independent of formal Coursework. When you create a project, a Codio 'Box' is created.

A Box is a virtual computer in the Cloud. You can do whatever you like with this box. Here are a few links to things you can do. Don't feel you have to master all of these things, but it is useful to know what Codio offers.

- Comprehensive [code editing](/docs/ide/editing/).
- [Installing software](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/), such as programming languages, databases, tools and libraries.
- Access the Box's [terminal](/docs/ide/boxes/terminal/).
- [Run](/docs/ide/boxes/runmenu/) your code.
- Use a preconfigured software [stack](/docs/dashboard/stacks/) to avoid lengthy configuration of the Box.
- Use a preconfigured [Starter Pack](/docs/dashboard/packs/). This is a Box fully configured with both pre-installed software as well as starting point code.
- [Deploy](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/) code to external sites and servers.
- Each Box comes with  [git](/docs/ide/editing/git/) installed automatically. You don't need to know about any of this but it is good to know for more advanced users.
- There are many very powerful features in Codio, so feel free to browse the [IDE](/docs/ide/) documentation.

## Creating a new Project
The first thing you will want to do is to create a new Project and try some coding. Check out the options below and why not start off by using a Starter Pack (see below)?

A project is a combination of a Box and your code workspace. When you open up your projects, the IDE file tree will be pointed to the code workspace automatically (for those who like detail, this is located at `~/workspace`).

Start off by ...

- clicking on the `Projects` option on the left of your Dashoard.
- click the `New Project` button in the top right of the screen

You can then choose which of the following Project creation methods you want to use

Select a commonly used Stack, for example:

- **LAMP:** LAMP Stack containing PHP, Apache and MySql with no code workspace.
- **Python3:** Python3 Stack with no code workspace.
- **Empty Stack:** an empty Ubuntu Box with no code workspace (suitable for HTML/CSS/JS projects).

or click on the **'Click here....'** to import or select an alternative software configuration:

- **[Starter Pack](/docs/dashboard/packs/)** which is the combination of a Stack and a pre-configured code workspace. This option means you can create complete Stack + Code templates that get you off to a flying start.
- **Import** where you can import from Git, BitBucket, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or from a Zip file.

To create a new coding project, follow these steps.

1. From your Codio dashboard, select **My Projects** from the left menu.
1. Click the **New Project** button in the top right.
1. Select a stack (more on Stacks [here](/docs/dashboard/stacks/))
1. Enter a project name. The short description is optional.
1. You can make the project private if you wish.
1. Press the **Create** button at the bottom of the page.

You are then taken into the code editor.

## Code editing and using the IDE
The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is where you write your code, access the terminal and access all of the Codio features. [Click here](/docs/ide) for a complete reference on the IDE.

You are able to install programming languages, databases and tools. [Click here](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/) for full details on how to install software on a Codio *Box*.

## Pre-installed software
Codio allows you to pre-configure things so when you or your students start a new project, they can have system software and code already pre-installed.

From the New Project screen look for the link **Want more options?** in 'Section 1'.

The 3 tabs here let you choose a starting point for your project. For pre-installed software and code, select either

- Choosing a [Stack](/docs/dashboard/stacks/) only (pre-installed system software) or
- Choosing a [Starter Pack](/docs/dashboard/packs/) (pre-installed system software along with starter code).


## Importing project code into a Codio project
Codio has special import options for importing existing code from Git, Mercurial, ZIP file, FTP or SFTP.

From the New Project screen look for the link **Want more options?** in 'Section 1'.

Select the **Import** tab in 'Section 1.' and then choose an import type. You can also specify a [Stack](/docs/dashboard/stacks/) if you want pre-configured software to be installed at the same time.

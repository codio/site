## Box parts

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**
>
> We are currently rolling out a new generation of Codio Boxes that will provide far greater power and control for you, as well as improved stability. These new Boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access, which means you no longer need to use the Box Parts package management system to install software. Instead, you can use the [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) package manager, which provides thousands of software packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu community.


Codio has a very easy to use software installer called **Box Parts** that lets you install software 

- from the command line
- from a helper utility

Full details on installing software as available [here](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/box-parts/).

Students are able to create their own coding projects with just 2 clicks. Here are the highlights ...

1. Create any number of projects
1. Being browser based, teachers and students can access their projects from the classroom and from home
1. Each projects gets its own, dedicated cloud server, a 'Computer in the Cloud'
1. Install any software you like on it (programming languages, databases, tools etc.)
1. Absolutely nothing for your school Systems Administrator to set up or configure
1. No security worries at all as everything runs on the Codio platform
1. You get a full blown code editor and IDE
1. Full access to the Linux command line
1. Download any code you write
1. You can use or configure a [Starter Pack](/docs/teacher/special/packs/) to give your students a Box preconfigured in any way you like (programming languages, databases, starter code, tools etc.). This means there is no setup required and students can immediately start working on any project along with the entire 'Stack' needed for coding projects, databases, tools etc.

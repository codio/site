We strongly recommend that teachers are aware of the following special teaching tools and resources that are aimed to promote computational thinking and provide assistance when learning to code.

## Video Overview
This video summarises many of Codio's unique teaching features.

## Auto-marked assessments
Codio contains 3 different types of assessments (Automated Code Tests, Multiple Choice and Fill in The Blanks) that can be automatically graded without teacher intervention. The results of these tests appear in the teacher dashboard.

## Teacher Only Solutions
Code challenges created in Codio content come with solutions that only the class teacher is able to see. This is an extremely helpful aid when in the classroom under pressure.

## Teacher dashboard
When teachers access a class in Codio, they are able to see the students in that class, the time spent by each student in that Unit and the results of their assessments.

## Flode
Flode is a very powerful, Codio integrated flowcharting tool with a big difference. Your Flode charts can run like real programs. This makes it a superb way of teaching programming concepts, computational thinking and algorithms.

## The Codio Computing platform
Codio lets you create your own coding projects. Each project is its own 'Computer in the Cloud' and gets its own server onto which you can install any software (programming languages, databases, tools) you choose. There are no security issues for you or your Network Administrator to worry about and it gives students incredible freedom to build whatever coding projects they like.

## Crunch
Crunch is a modern replacement for Little Man Computer. Fully integrated into Codio it is very easy to use and has a more complete instruction set than LMC.

## Lexikon
The Codio Lexikon is an integrated help system that lets users lookup information quickly and easily as new topics are learned without having to trawl the web.

## Tkinter
For teachers wanting to teach UI building with Python (please note that OCR GCSE does not require this) this gives you the tools to build and run Tkinter UIs in the Cloud.

## Stacks & Starter Packs
**Stacks** give you the ability to preconfigure any Box configuration you like so students do not have to worry about installing and configuring software, languages, tools etc. before they start coding.
[Click here for details](/docs/teacher/special/stacks)

**Starter Packs** allow you to preconfigure not just the Stack but also any 'starting point code' so your students can start off at whatever point you want them to.

## Dyslexia support
The Codio teaching content and the code editor both come with special fonts and reading bars which make it easier for dyslexic students to follow content and write code.

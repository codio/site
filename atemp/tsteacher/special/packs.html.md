![Pack List](/img/docs/packs_list.png)

A [Starter Pack](/docs/dashboard/packs/) gives you the ability to configure both a Stack and project code and then store these in your private Starter Packs listing. You can also publish these for others to see.

You can use this feature so you and others you give access to, are able to instantly create a working project without the need to install either code or dependencies.

##Creating a Project from a Pack
To create a Project from your Starter Packs listing, simply select it and you'll be shown the information screen.

From here, you can click the 'Use Starter Pack' button and you'll be taken to the Create Project screen.

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**
>
> We are currently rolling out a new generation of Codio Boxes that will provide far greater power and control for you, as well as improved stability. These new Boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access, which means you no longer need to use the Box Parts package management system to install software. Instead, you can use the [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) package manager, which provides thousands of software packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu community.

![Stacks List](/img/docs/stacks_list.png)

Codio [Stacks](/docs/dashboard/stacks/) offers you a range of Certified Stacks that contain commonly used, pre-configured software dependencies (languages, databases and other components).

Additionally, you can create your own Stacks within a Project using the [Install software](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/) option. Once you have configured everything, you can create your own Stack from this project and it will appear in your private Stacks listing. You can even publish Stacks for others to see.

##Creating a Project from a Stack
To create a Project from your Stacks listing, simply select it and you'll be shown the Stack information screen.

From here, you can click the 'Use Stack' button and you'll be taken to the Create Project screen.

There are various ways to contribute to Guides content that we or other parties have written. 

## Codio's Content Repositories
Any piece of Codio authored content will generally have an associated repository. Codio's are located on BitBucket at this location.

https://bitbucket.org/codiocontent

You will need to create a BitBucket account but this is quick and free.

## Guide specific repository location
Each piece of content will usually have a welcome page as the first or last page of the Guide. This contains relevant copyright information as well as the location of the repository for that content under the "Guide Repository & Issues" heading.

## General comments and suggestions
If you want to comment on any content then within the Guide you should look for the "Guide Repository & Issues" heading and click on the "Issues and Comments" link. 

You will be required to create a BitBucket account to submit issues, for which there is no charge.

## Contributing improvements
We welcome actual contributions to the content. This can range from typo corrections to completely new sections. There are two ways to contribute content.

1. You can create the content in any general text format you like and then add your comments and the content as described in General comments and suggestions above.
2. You can collaborate using Git. If you prefer this route, then you will need to be familiar with Git and issuing Pull Requests. 

## Basis for contributing
If you wish to contribute then please be aware that you have to agree to assign all necessary rights to Codio to use your contributions in any way Codio chooses, including the ability to copy, modify, sublicense these contributions. 

If you are not comfortable with assigning rights in this way then please do not make any contributions. You are more than welcome to make suggestions where you see a need for improvement and we will look to add these improvements ourselves on your behalf.

## Copyright
If you clone or fork any content then please respect the copyright of the author, whether Codio or anyone else. You should not remove or modify any copyright statements from a cloned or forked Guide.

If there is no explicit copyright statement then please be aware that does not mean that there is no copyright. Under international laws, there is an assumed copyright on all content in the absence of a copyright statement or content license agreement.

This tutorial shows how Grunt trigger build tasks as soon as files change in your project.

We've got a really cool physics demo written in Coffeescript and we're going to show how to compile the entire project as well as only files that have changed.

[Go to the Tutorial](https://github.com/codio/tutorial_grunt_watch_coffee) - just follow the instructions in our GitHub repo.

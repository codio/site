Grunt is a must-know task automation tool that manages build tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, linting etc.

This tutorial shows you how a web site is prepared for production using the following tasks: concatenation, js minification & uglification, css minification, cache-busting for images, js and css files and finally, the fixing up of references to js, css and image files once they have undergone these transformations. Enjoy!

We've added Codio annotations, so it's a really great way to learn. Click on the link below, then follow the README.md instructions.

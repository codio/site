Node, preinstalled on all Codio boxes, is made available via the Node Version Manager, [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). With a few simple commands it allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them as and when you wish.

At the time of writing, your Codio Box has Node v0.10.25 installed for you. Open up the terminal and run the following to check this:

```bash
node --version
# v0.10.25
```

To install a different version of Node:

```bash
nvm install 0.8
# Now using node v0.8.26
```

You can now switch versions easily:

```bash
nvm use 0.10
nvm use 0.8
```

Checkout the [nvm Github repo](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for documentation.

## The npm Package Manager
You can install Node modules using the npm package manager. Check out [howtonode.org](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) for a good introduction to npm.

##Accessing your application
Once your Node app is up and running, you can access your project from a browser or API call etc. This is easily using done using [Preview button](/docs/ide/inline-preview). When you click it, you will see the URL to your Box, which will look something like this

`word1-word2.codio.io:port`

##Writing your first Node application
We've written a simple tutorial on writing a 'Hello World' Node application that can be found [here](/docs/specifics/quick-node).

<section id="overview">
  <h2>Codio in Education : support our campaign</h2>
  <p>Most school curricula focus on using Word, Excel and office productivity tools - things that kids these days pick up in 5 minutes without any instruction. Governments are now trying to put in place curricula that incorporate coding. It's quite easy to imagine how a committee designed curriculum might look. Not compatible with the dynamic world of IT and especially not when it comes to learning to code. By the time a curriculum has been worked through and published, large chunks will be out of date and it will be static for years to come.</p>

  <p>We propose an alternative solution that is more fit for purpose - letting the community take charge of its own destiny. We propose that the world's coders, working together, can do a better job of providing the learning materials, infrastructure and motivation needed to train the next generation of coders. We might be wrong,  but we believe this 'crowd-teaching' approach is a better solution to the problem that one designed by committee.</p>

  <p>We are playing our own small part by providing part of the infrastructure that can support this approach, but we need the community and industry to get behind the idea too. And to shout us down too if you feel we're way off the mark.</p>

<section id="annotations">
  <h2>Codio:Annotations</h2>
  <p>Codio:Annotations, which is 100% free, is one of the main drivers of our educational efforts and is now available. You can watch a short overview video below or go to the <a href="/s/docs/annotations/">documentation</a>.</p>
  <a href="http://youtube.com/v/Fk3eG_eSRPM" class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" id="video">
    <img src="//i3.ytimg.com/vi/Fk3eG_eSRPM/mqdefault.jpg" />
    <i class="icon-play-circle icon-4x"></i>
  </a>
  <p>Codio:Annotations is a set of features within the Codio IDE that allows anyone to richly annotate any code project of any complexity. It supports any programming language allowing people to get a guided tour around the code, as well as browse randomly around the project and take a "what's this?" approach.</p>
  <p>You can use Annotations right now. Just check out our <a href="/#examples">examples</a> or dive right in and create your own annotations - just click "Create &amp; Play" above.</p>

<section id="curation">
  <h2>Curation</h2>
  <p>Codio will soon be adding a front-end layer that allows the community to collaborate in a Wiki like way on the way that teaching materials are structured and organized. Tutorials can be assigned to places within the curation structure so they can be found easily. We will also offer voting and commenting features so the best tutorials can float to the top and improved through feedback.</p>

<section id="github">
  <h2>The GitHub Project</h2>
  <p>GitHub is the clear leader in open source collaboration projects. Codio will soon be setting up a GitHub project that will be a goto place for tutorials of any kind. It is designed to work fully independently of Codio but the <a href="#curation">Codio curation</a> features will provide a very friendly front-end for students and learners.</p>

  <p>We are going to include a standard 'Creative Commons' license in tutorials by default. Of course, people are free to use any license they want but by recommending the usage of this for all tutorials, we aim to encourage proliferation and constant improvement of tutorials by anyone who feels they have something to add.</p>

<section id="inspiration">
  <h2>An inspirational video from Sugata Mitra</h2>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud.html?source=twitter&utm_content=addthis-custom&awesm=on.ted.com_q4t2&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=on.ted.com-twitter&utm_campaign=#.UTZGQKJHkoV.twitter">This TED talk</a> is truly inspirational. It tells the story of how Sugata put a 'hole-in-the-wall' computer, connected to the web, in a small village in India where the kids hadn't seen a computer and couldn't speak any English. He then went away for 3 months and left them to it. When he came back, the kids had not only collectively figured out how to use the computer, they had taught themselves English so they could figure out how to use it.</p>
  <p>This concept has a lot in common with what we are proposing with our Education program. Communities are great at figuring things out and so are kids. We hope to provide encouragement, some tools, get a community started and then get out of the way.</p>

<section id="inspire">
  <h2>Inspire Program</h2>
  <p>With the Inspire Program, we will recruit renowned coders from all the world to deliver short, informal, ad hoc talks that aim to inspire the next generation of programmers. These will be in video format and will be published under the Educode License so teachers and collaborators are free to do with them whatever they like.</p>
  <p>Hope the guys at <a target="_blank" href="http://code.org">code.org</a> don't mind us using their image. We're all pulling in the same direction when it comes to inspiration.</p>

          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Codio is a trading name for the Codio Service and is fully owned by Application Craft UK Ltd. (the &quot;Company&quot;). Application Craft UK Ltd. is legally responsible for all representations made under the Codio name with respect to users of Codio products and services.</p>

<p>Effective May 9th, 2013</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">1. Your Agreement with the Company</h3>

<p><strong>1.1</strong> Your use of the Codio service is governed by this agreement (the &quot;Terms&quot;). The Company is located at 29 Wood Street, Stratford Upon Avon CV37 6JG, United Kingdom and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Codio Service. The “Codio Services” means the services Codio makes available through this website, including this website, the Codio cloud computing platform, the Codio APIs, any Codio Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by Codio in connection to any of those.</p>

<p><strong>1.2</strong> In order to use the Codio Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Codio Services. You understand and agree that Codio will treat your use of the Codio Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>

<p><strong>1.3</strong> You may not use the Codio Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Codio Services under the laws of the United Kingdom or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Codio Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Codio Services are not intended for children under 13.</p>

<p><strong>1.4</strong> You agree your purchases of Codio Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Codio or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">2. Your Account and Use of the Codio Services</h3>

<p><strong>2.1</strong> You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Codio Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Codio immediately.</p>

<p><strong>2.2</strong> Your use of the Codio Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p>

<p><strong>2.3</strong> You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Codio Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Codio in connection with the Codio Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Codio, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Codio Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>

<p><strong>2.4</strong> Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained here (or such URL as Codio may provide). The Codio Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Codio reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in Codio serving a “quota exceeded” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the Codio Services (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.</p>

<p><strong>2.5</strong> You may use the Codio Services only to develop and run applications on the Codio infrastructure. You may not access the Codio Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Codio or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Codio Services.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">3. Service Policies and Privacy</h3>

<p><strong>3.1</strong> You agree to comply with the Codio Acceptable Use Policy available at acceptable use policy (the &quot;Acceptable Use Policy&quot;) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>3.2</strong> The Codio Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Codio Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Codio&#39;s privacy policies.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">4. Fees for Use of the Codio Services</h3>

<p><strong>4.1</strong> Subject to the Terms, the Codio Services are provided to you without charge up to certain limits and with certain feature restrictions as displayed on the Codio web site. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at pricing (or such URL as Codio may provide).</p>

<p><strong>4.2</strong> For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly or annual basis or at the interval indicated in Codio fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and professional fees Codio incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Codio measurements of your use of the Codio Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Codio and only in the form of credit for the Codio Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Codio to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Codio may be shared by Codio with companies who work on Codio behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Codio and servicing your account. Codio may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as court summonses, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Codio shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Codio reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Codio Services to you for any late payments.</p>

<p><strong>4.3</strong> Codio may change its fees and payment policies for the Codio Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Codio may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>

<p><strong>4.4</strong> You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Codio Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">5. Content on the Codio Services and Take Down Obligations</h3>

<p><strong>5.1</strong> You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Codio Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the &quot;Content.&quot; The term Content shall specifically exclude any applications or content that you create using the Codio Services and any source code written by you to be used with the Codio Services (collectively, &quot;Applications&quot;).</p>

<p><strong>5.2</strong> Codio reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove any or all Content from the Codio Services. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Acceptable Use Policy, including pursuant to a take down request from Codio.

Codio reserves the right to disable Applications in response to a violation or suspected violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>

<p><strong>5.4</strong> You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Codio has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Codio Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Codio may suffer) by doing so.</p>

<p><strong>5.5</strong> You agree that Codio has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up your Applications and any Content.</p>

<p><strong>6.1</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Codio (or Codio licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Codio Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Codio Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>

<p><strong>6.2</strong> Except as provided in Section 8, Codio acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Codio Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist the Applications (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

<h3 id="toc_16">18. General Legal Terms</h3>

<p><strong>18.1</strong> The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and the Company and govern your use of the Codio Services (but excluding any services which Codio may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and the Company in relation to the Codio Services.</p>

<p><strong>18.2</strong> There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.</p>

<p><strong>18.3</strong> If the Company provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.</p>

<p><strong>18.4</strong> You agree that the Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Codio web site. By providing the Company your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>

<p><strong>18.5</strong> You agree that if the Company does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which the Company has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of the Company rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to the Company.</p>

<p><strong>18.6</strong> The Company shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.</p>

<p><strong>18.7</strong> The Terms, and your relationship with the Company under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of England without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within England (United Kingdom) to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.</p>

<p><strong>18.8</strong> Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the Codio Services upon written notice to the assigning party.</p>

As you may have read in previous posts, we're trying to change the approach to IT education and we believe that coding needs to be centre stage - well at least on stage - in schools. One of the great things about coding is that it can be fun and can draw on other strengths and talents.

The example projects you see below draw on creativity, math, physics and even a smattering of art. We are trying to get people to realize that **CODING IS FUN**.

If anyone has cool examples of code that draws on talent and creativity from other areas, please add your suggestions in the comments below this post.

## Explore
Below are three simple projects displayed in the Codio IDE (which is live and clickable, so go ahead). Each of these can be run in the browser (press Preview button) and you can explore the code in the IDE.

## Tearable Cloth
**IMPORTANT:** this is a live IDE, not an image, so explore the code and press Preview to run the code.

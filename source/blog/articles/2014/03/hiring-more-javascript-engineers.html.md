**We need help building the world's most powerful web IDE...**

As one of our front-end engineers, you'll be responsible for building arguably the most important part of Codio. The IDE itself is a single page app built using the latest Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. We hate IE and love any browser which sits on the cutting edge of the web, so you will be encouraged to play with and implement the latest and greatest.

As well as the IDE, we also have several NodeJS applications that support the IDE, and we need you to help maintain and expand these.

You are also our target market for the product itself, which makes it an extremely attractive and exciting product to work on. You've most likely heard this said before, but we really do have something that is built for developers, and by developers. We want you to be happy to use Codio as your day to day IDE, and if you aren't, help us to get there.

We want someone who is free thinking, passionate and has a love of what they do. If you find yourself still hacking away at 4am without realising the time, then you're the kind of person we want.

## What we want from you:
 - 3+ years professional experience.
 - Experience and knowledge of Javascript (including jQuery), HTML5 and CSS3.
 - Recognition of the benefits of test driven development and well tested code.
 - Knowledge of the browser market and its changing pace.
 - An eye for detail, both in your code and in the browser. Developers can be a picky bunch you know ;)
 - Common sense when it comes to UI and UX.
 - Work well in a team and on your own.
 - A love of open source software.

## You'll be at an advantage if you also:
 - Have an eye for good design, UI and UX.
 - Enjoy writing, blogging and speaking at tech conferences.
 - Have experience with Java.
 - Contribute or have created any open source software (big brownie points for this one).

We're a distributed team with our HQ in the UK, so you will be able to work from anywhere you please. We would prefer if you were UK or European based, but if you're really good, we don't care where you are.

## To Apply
Drop us an email at [work@codio.com](mailto:work@codio.com) telling us why we should hire you, along with your resume/CV if you have one. Although we'd be much more interested in your GitHub profile, which speaks volumes about you and what you are capable of.

If you have any questions, please let me know in the blog comments.

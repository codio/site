Yes, that’s right - you can now browse repos, and with one click, instantly launch your code in the Codio web IDE.  No git commands, just a single click and hey presto!

We’ve added a special BitBucket authentication for Codio & BitBucket users.  Once a user has performed this a first time – there’s no need for repeat authentication, the project simply loads and users can start editing in Codio immediately.

With your code open in the Codio IDE, we automatically provision your Git repo so it’s ready for your session.  You can modify your code and push it straight back to your BitBucket repo. Simple.

So BitBucket users have an instant code editor at their disposal that runs in the browser with nothing, yes, nothing to install! Not only do BitBucket users enjoy a free instant cloud based code editor – Codio now comes packed with Codio [Stacks](/docs/dashboard/stacks) and [Starter Packs](/docs/dashboard/packs) – that’s right, a rich library of pre-configured software stacks and other components each available instantly.

As a default Codio no longer offers free private projects – but for the BitBucket integration we’re making an exception – meaning BitBucket users new to Codio don’t pay a dime!  If you do need more than one private repo you can opt for a Codio subscription, from as little as $7 per month for education users, and upwards for the hardcore professionals.

Look out for a Codio course tutorial to support the integration – coming soon – and for more news and updates from Team Codio, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codiohq), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/codiohq) or [Google+](https://google.com/+Codio), [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_pvWqpowhOlwOwO3nVsaw?sub_confirmation=1) to our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_pvWqpowhOlwOwO3nVsaw?sub_confirmation=1) for Codio’s “Ask the Experts” video series, or share your ideas and suggestions in the [forum](http://forum.codio.com).

Ike DeLorenzo, Product Manager at Bitbucket commented:

> "The Bitbucket team is excited to be integrating cloud-based coding environments. The partners we are working with have the scalability, ease-of-use, and efficiency our community has come to expect from Bitbucket itself.  For developers who increasingly turn to the cloud for version control, build, and deployment options, we see tight integration of a best-of-class cloud IDE like Codio as a natural extension."

Codio’s founder and CEO, Freddy May, added:

> “Codio has always focused on delighting users with instant access anywhere to a powerful web IDE, and with today's integration we're thrilled to extend that experience to Bitbucket."

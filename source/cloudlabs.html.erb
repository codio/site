      Codio CloudLabs is an infinitely scalable Computer Science lab in the Cloud. You might think
      it's just virtualization but it's not. In fact, it goes so far beyond virtual machines that you'll
      be totally amazed.

          CloudLabs lets faculty teach anything. Any programming language, database or other software components.
          It also lets users work from anywhere. You are no longer bound to the CS lab. Students just open up a
          browser on any machine, anywhere, sign-in and they have access to all their servers and a browser based IDE.

          Containerization makes CloudLabs unbelievably affordable. When a server is not being used, it is automatically
          shut down so it does not consume resources. As soon as it is accessed, it spins up in just a couple of seconds.
          Exactly as you left it.

        <div class="text">
          Many of our customers are saving considerable amounts of money by reducing their need to invest in shiny new
          hardware every few years. Because everything runs on our infrastructure, all you need is a browser. And if
          students have their own laptops then you can significantly reduce the number of lab PCs you buy and maintain.

          System Administrators are overloaded. CloudLabs means that whenever you want a particular software
          configuration for you and your students, you can configure it in an instant without burdening your
          SysAdmin team. No need for sysadmins to conjure up custom configurations they are not familiar with and
          they donâ€™t need to worry about security.

          Getting going is instantaneous. There are no complex setup procedures. You just create an account and faculty
          and students can be creating and managing servers and coding projects immediately. And as you add more and
          more students you will never need to worry about scalability. We take care of that.

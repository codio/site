If you do not want to use the Codio IDE to add your annotations you can do it just as easily using any IDE. You simply insert the tokens in your editor and create an `annotations.codio` file at the root level.

The only thing that you do not get with this approach is the benefit of helpers. However, for editors that have snippet support (Textmate, SublimeText for example) you can create helpers that insert tokens. Codio helpers do a bit more besides inserting tokens, as they also can jump from the source to the correct location in the `annotations.codio' file and vice-versa to save you looking for the matching point.

#Importing your own Project into Codio
If you are building your project in your own IDE then there are several quick ways of [importing an external project](/docs/console/creating/) either from GitHub or a ZIP file.

**COMING SOON : Watch this space**

Codio will soon be introducing a Javascript widget that lets you display code snippets from your Codio project directly within any web page. You can reference any `@annotation` token from this widget, including `@annotation:tour` snippets.

There are some nice advantages to using this approach

- no copying and pasting your code
- if you change the source project in any way, the snippet being displayed in your web page will be updated automatically
- the user can click within the code snippet to load the IDE and see its context

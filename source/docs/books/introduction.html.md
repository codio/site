Codio Books lets you build a complete book, with chapters, sections and pages that can be nested to any depth to form a table of contents and associated content that mirrors a normal book structure. Parts of a book can then be mapped to course units for class assignments.

Often, a student will want to review materials taught earlier in a course. With books, they are able to do this even though that content does not form a part of the current unit. This is very useful for revision purposes prior to lab, assessments, exams etc.

A Codio book still sits on top of a Codio box so you have the same capabilities that projects and units have. Before we introduced books, switching units wasted time as a new unit needed to load, which took several seconds. If you frequently switch units (for instance during student revision) this delay becomes irritating. With a book, there is no delay and the student can freely access all parts of the book irrespective of which unit they are accessing.

### Recommendations
We strongly recommend you have a thorough understanding of the following before embarking on large scale books.

- [Content authoring](/docs/content/authoring)
- [Courses](/docs/courses), especially how [courses map to books](/docs/courses/units/unit-add)
- [Assigning content to classes](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/assign-module)
- Limitations (see below)

### Limitations, restrictions and when not to use a book
There are cases where authoring your content in a book is not appropriate. For more information on this, please refer to [limitations and restrictions](/docs/books/limitations).


### Courses
Rather than assign a Book to a class, you can map any sections of the Book to the usual course and module structure. So you can still divide a course into modules and units and assign these to a class but, provided the course author allow it, students can look at any part of the book even when assigned a single unit. This is ideal for referring back to material covered previously and for general revision. See [Book Visibility](/docs/classes/classmanagement/bookvisibility) for more information.

### Assessments
Although it is entirely up to the book author, a book will usually contains a number of assessments. When you map a course unit to a section of the book, any assessments that fall within that unit are shown in the class dashboard.

You should make a decision as to when assessments should be in the book and when they are better suited to a project unit. Generally speaking, standard assessments that are used to monitor student engagement with content belong in the book.

Questions that are assigned to a class for homework or lab assessments could also go in a book but are usually better in a course project unit. Please refer to [limitations and restrictions](/docs/books/limitations) for a discussion on cheating related risks to putting assessments in a book.

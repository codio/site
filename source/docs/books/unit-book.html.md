Books cannot be accessed directly by students. Once your book is [published](/docs/books/publish), you need to map parts of it to one or more course units, which can then be [assigned to a class](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/assign-module).

Please [click here](/docs/courses/units/unit-add) for a detailed explanation on mapping book content to course units.

Your Box will be active while you are using the IDE. However, we will put it to sleep ...

- 2 minutes after you exit your project in the IDE
- 30 minutes after there is no IDE activity

The good news is that the startup time for your Box is extremely fast, so you will not even notice your Box starting up!

##Auto Starting Services
If you use services (Apache for example) then when you exit your project and come back to it later, the services will NOT auto start. However, you can easily [configure a `startup.sh`](/docs/boxes/startup) file to do just this.

##Always On Boxes
If you want to have an [Always On Box](/docs/boxes/always-on), we will be introducing these soon with a paid subscription.

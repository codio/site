Being in Beta, you can be sure to find bugs. You can also be sure we will fix them very quickly. If you do find a bug, PLEASE report it to us. We have made this really easy to do.

It's best if you create an account and sign into your account to do this. Creating an account is simple and free and you get to reserve you own Codio URL. We also issues announcements on new features through this messaging system (which is from [intercom.io](http://intercom.io) by the way and is really very cool).

If you don't want to create an account, you can [email us directly](mailto:ee8711023afa04b80a6b921ddb3939c1171e0f62@incoming.intercom.io).

In the Codio site bar, you will see an envelope icon. Click on this and you can send us a message describing any issues you find. We will also notify you of updates to the system through this. If there are unread messages, you will see an unread message count superimposed.

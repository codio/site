In real life, your class may be taught by more than one teacher. If this is the case, you can add another teacher to your Codio class in the following way:


1. From the **Classes** area, click on your class to open it.

1. Click on the **Admin** tab, centre right of your screen.

1. If the teacher is not a member of your Organisation, you can send them an invitation email.

1. An email will be sent to your colleague containing a link where they can sign up for a Codio account and on completion they will be added into your Organisation and Class automatically.
N.B. They must use the email address the invitation was sent to or they will not be added to the Organisation or Class.

Creating a book based unit in a course allows you to point to any parts of a book for that unit. Students can see the parts of the book that the unit related to in the table of contents. 

The course and class manager is also able to specify that parts of the book not mapped to by the unit either a) can be seen or b) cannot be seen in the class.

This is controlled from the Admin section in the class

This option will only show in a class where there is a course containing book based units

- **Show only unit pages** will only show the part of the book mapped to that unit
- **Show all pages** will show all the book content and the areas not mapped to that specific unit will  be greyed out in the table of contents and the content pages will be 'read-only'

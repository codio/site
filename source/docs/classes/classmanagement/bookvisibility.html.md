A book based unit can map to parts of a book. Students can see the mapped book portions of the book in the table of contents. 

You can also specify that parts of the book not mapped to by the unit either a) can be seen or b) cannot be seen in the class. This setting applies to all units in the class.

It is controlled from the Admin section in the class

This option will only show in a class if there is a course containing book based units.

Select **Edit Details** button and flip the switch to change the settings as required.

- **Show only unit pages** will only show the part of the book mapped to that unit.
- **Show all pages** will show all the book content and the areas not mapped to that specific unit will be grayed out in the table of contents.

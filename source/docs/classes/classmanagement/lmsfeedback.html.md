If your organisation uses an LMS, when grades are released a URL is passed to the LMS grading area where students/teachers can access the grading information for the unit.

By default, only the class teachers and the individual student can access the grading preview but by enabling the LMS shared feedback option,

this will pass a different URL back to your LMS system where anyone who knows the URL can access the students grading information

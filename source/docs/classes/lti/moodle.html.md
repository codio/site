Please be sure to check out the [Codio LTI App](/docs/classes/lti/ltiapp) which allows for an easy way to integrate and to map Codio class units to your LMS system.

### Authentication and account creation
Once you have configured the LTI/LMS settings, Moodle manages all aspects of signing in to Codio as well as account creation. All your teachers and students need is a Moodle account.

If a Moodle user has never used Codio before then an account will automatically be created when they access their first Codio course materials.

If a Moodle user already has a Codio account then **provided the email address of their Codio account matches the email address of their LMS account** the same Codio account will be used. If, however, the user has used a different email address within Codio, then a new Codio account will be created that matches that of the Moodle account.

## Setup, configuration and usage
The following instructions are provided as short videos.

### One time setup
You will not have access to the Moodle/LMS features unless you have an educational organization setup as explained in the video.

**Important** : Codio needs the User Role, Email Address and Name of the Moodle user in order to work. It is important that you access the LTI security settings and ensure that these three fields are always enabled.

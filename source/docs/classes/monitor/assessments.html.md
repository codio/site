Auto-graded assessments allow you to view your students’ progress throughout the modules and units that have been assigned. 
Codio’s [curriculum-mapped content](/docs/content/courses/recommended) contains [auto-graded assessments](/docs/content/authoring/assessments). 
Assign curriculum to your class and then [view your students’ progress](/docs/teacher/assess/progress).

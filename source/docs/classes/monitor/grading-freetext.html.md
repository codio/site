Free text questions will normally require a manual grading process. In order to grade these questions, you should first select the unit. You will then be shown the student list, as you can see below.

<img alt="StudentList" src="/img/docs/studentlist.png" class="simple"/>

You can now select a student. You will then be shown the list of all assessments for that student within the unit. Free text questions are denoted by the icon highlighted below.

Note that if a student has started to answer a question but not submitted the answer, then you will see **DRAFT** written next to it. Once they submit, you will see **GRADE** indicating that the question has been submitted and is ready to be graded.

### Partial Point Rubric

Where an answer is set to all partial points, a rubric is provided to allow graders to dynamically deduct points from the maximum score.
A grader can add an item, change an item weight or remove an item at any time in grading. The change will be applied for all students in this unit, and any changes in rubric will upgrade already graded students to implement changes. The rubric is dynamic for each unit, and every new unit starts with an empty rubric.

#### Rubric
Every rubric item is 2 fields, first is the rubric item weight and the second one line item name.

- If an item is selected, then the weight is deducted from students score.
- The grader can select multiple items. 
- The total score can't be negative even if sum of rubric items weights is more than maximum points.

#### Editing
Editing is allowed while grading so the teacher can:

- add a new item into the form
- remove an item. As this action will effect all students already graded and their total score updated, a warning is shown for confirmation
- edit the weight or name.  If weight is changed a warning will be shown for confirmation

#### Points adjust
The points adjust field allows the teacher/instructor to manually adjust (ie reduce) the students total score if required without having to edit/change the rubric

#### Feedback
A comments field is provided to allow teacher/instructors manual feedback


If a class deadline is reached, then you can grade questions that are  set to **DRAFT** and where the student may have forgotten to submit the answer fully.

You can also see the date and time for each submitted answer as well as the date that the unit was [marked as complete](/docs/dashboard/student/guides#completed) by the student.

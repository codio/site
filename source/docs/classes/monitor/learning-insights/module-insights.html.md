- **Avg. Time Spent** - The average time spent by the students in the module.
- **Avg. Grade** - The average grade of the students in the module.
- **Student Grade vs Time Spent** - A scatter plot visualization of the average student grade vs. time spent in the module to identify students that need help, need more of a challenge or are within the zone of proximal development (ZPD)—an estimate of student cognitive load.

    - Hover over the data points to see their corresponding values.
    - Click on the data points to drill through and see the names of the students.


- **Module Breakdown** - A grouped bar chart visualization to compare the number of students that started a given unit, the number of students that completed that unit, the average student grade in the unit, and the average time spent by students on it.

    - Hover over the bars to see their corresponding values.

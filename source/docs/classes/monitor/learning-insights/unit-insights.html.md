Key Features:

- **Class Logistics** - The number of students that started the unit, total number of students and assessments, all in one place.
- **Avg. Assessments Answered** - The average number of assessments answered by the class in the current module.
- **Avg. Time Spent** - The average time spent by the students in the unit.
- **Avg. Grade** - The average grade of the students in the unit.
- **% of Total Time** - The average percentage of time spent on the unit out of the total time spent by the class.
- **Avg. Grade Impact** - The average grade impact of the unit on class average grade (i.e. the number points the average grade of the class increased or decreased due to class performance in the unit).

- **Student Grade vs Time Spent** - A scatter plot visualization of the average student grade vs. time spent in the module to identify students that need help, need more of a challenge or are within the zone of proximal development (ZPD)—an estimate of student cognitive load.

    - Hover over the data points to see their corresponding values.

- **Needs a Challenge** - The list of students from the class that may need a challenge on account of Low Cognitive Load.
- **Table of Everything** - A sortable “table of everything” with all relevant student data from the class.

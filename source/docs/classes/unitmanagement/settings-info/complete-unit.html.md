Certain actions can be triggered when a student marks a unit as complete

- [Auto-graded assessment scores can be passed directly to the grade field](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/autograde#transfer)
- [Scripts can be executed for assessing the student code and assigning the grade](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/autograde#script)

Students can mark the unit as complete from their own dashboards but a teacher is also able to do this on their behalf either individually or for all students. 

- Press the **Marking All As Completed** button to mark all student units as complete
- Hover over a student to see the switch appear to the left of the students name, which you can then activate

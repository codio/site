In the event that a unit in your course/classes is updated, you can reset it so **all** students who have already started the unit can start again with the updated content. You can also reset the unit even if there have been no updates to the content so students can start the unit again. 

You should be aware that when you reset a unit, all student work on that unit will be lost, so you may wish to advise them of your actions.

You can reset the unit for all your students by selecting either:

- the **Actions** button and then the **Reset** button

or 

- you can reset the unit for individual students from the 3 blue dot menu

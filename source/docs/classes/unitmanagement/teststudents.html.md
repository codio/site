Codio automatically creates 3 test students for you. This allows instructors to view the student experience when units are assigned to classes.

1.  They can be seen in the members section.

1.  You can log in as the student dashboard by clicking the **Login as** button here:

1. Or you can also log in as the student within a class as well:

1.  You can switch back to teacher mode by clicking **Switch back to teacher account**.

However, if your Codio class is LMS integrated then you will need to perform your testing from the LMS and not use the Codio test students.

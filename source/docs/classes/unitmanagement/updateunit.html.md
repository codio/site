Individual units can also be updated if required although in most cases where you have added a Course into a class, the **[Upgrade Course](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse/)** feature is recommended. 

Click on the 3 blue vertical dots and select **Update Unit**

Updating a Unit allows you to overwrite the Guides (.guides) folder for all students who have already started this Unit. All other student data will not be affected. Any material changes to assessments configuration may result in lost data for deleted or modified assessment questions for those students who have already responded.

### Projects assigned to the Class

If your Unit was added using [Add Project](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/assign-project), the Update Unit option also allows you to also update the Source project and Stack as well as overwriting the Guides (.guides) folder for students who have already started the Unit.

### [Reset Unit](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/reset-unit/)

In the event that the unit(s) in your class are updated, you can reset them so any students who have already started the unit can start again with the updated content.

You can also reset the unit(s) even if there have been no updates to the content so the student(s) can start the unit(s) again.

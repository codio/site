### Projects assigned to the Class

Individual units can be updated ,although in most cases where you have added a Course into a class, the **[Upgrade Course](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse/)** should be used.

Click on the 3 blue vertical dots and select **Update Unit**

Updating a Unit allows you to overwrite the Guides (.guides) folder for all students who have already started this Unit. All other student data will not be affected. Any material changes to assessments configuration may result in lost data for deleted or modified assessment questions for those students who have already responded.

### [Reset Unit](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/reset-unit/)

In the event that the unit(s) in your class are updated, you can reset them so any students who have already started the unit can start again with the updated content.

You can also reset the unit(s) even if there have been no updates to the content so the student(s) can start the unit(s) again.

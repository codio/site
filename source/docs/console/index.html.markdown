When you sign into Codio, you are shown the Dashboard

![Console](/img/docs/console-screen.png)


From here you can create and manage your projects, order your project list, search for projects, update your project settings, see the visibility status of your projects (Public or Private), if the project is enabled for [cloning](/docs/boxes/clone) and access the [Project Settings](/docs/settings-prefs/project-settings)

In Project Settings you can:

- Change the Project Name.
- Add a description to your Project.
- Change the Visibility of your Project.
- Enable [Box Cloning](docs/boxes/clone).
- Delete your Project.
- Export your Project as a zip file.

Codio has very rich tutorial content authoring tools.

A book and a guide are very similar.

- They allow you to author tutorial content
- They allow you to create assessments
- They have the same authoring tools.

It is very important that you understand whether to create your content as a project, a project unit or a book, so please read the overview pages thoroughly.

### Complex table of contents
Codio Books was introduced in August 2017. The idea behind a book is that it allows an author to create teaching material of any length. A much improved table of contents supports chapters and sections. Sections can be nested within chapters to any depth unlike guides, which have only one level of nesting.

### Speed
With a standard project based course unit, when students want to switch from one unit to another, there is a delay while the new unit is loaded. If a student wants to refer to different parts of the course then the repeated delays can become frustrating.

With a book, you can have all of the teaching content in a single book based project. As a result, the student can freely access any part of the book at any time without delays.

### Book based course units
Portions of a book can me mapped to by a Codio course. When you create a new course unit, you can decide whether to point to a standard project type unit or a portion of a book. 

If you point to a portion of a book, you can map a chapter, section or pages in any combination. When the student then access the unit, the unit portion of the book is clearly highlighted in the table of contents so it is clear which content is currently being taught. 

The student can still (unless explicitly disabled by the teacher/instructor) access other parts of the book for revision purposes.

### Conclusion
In general, it is a good idea to put standard teaching materials and canned assessments into a Book and map corresponding course units to the book. Class or lab assignments should be put into project based units. 

Please read the next page for a more detailed exploration of the relationship between books, courses and classes.

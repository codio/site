A Codio Guide has been available for a long time. It allows you to create tutorial contents for that project and currently only allows one level of table of contents nesting. Later in 2017 we will upgrade the guides editor to have the same table of contents capabilities as a book.

A book is very similar to a project with a Codio guide. The main differences are is that portions of a book's contents can be mapped to a course unit. A standard course unit maps to an entire project.

### Complex table of contents
Books was introduced in August 2017. The idea behind a book is that it allows an author to create teaching material of any length. A much improved table of contents supports chapters and sections. Sections can be nested within chapters to any depth unlike guides, which have only one level of nesting.

### Speed
With a standard project based course unit, when students want to switch from one unit to another, there is a delay while the new unit is loaded. If a student wants to refer to different parts of the course then the repeated delays can become frustrating.

With a book, you can have all of the teaching content in a single book based project. As a result, the student can freely access any part of the book at any time without delays.

### Book based course units
Books is fully supported by a Codio course. When you create a new course unit, you can decide whether to point to a standard project type unit or a portion of a book. 

If you point to a portion of a book, you can map a chapter, section or pages in any combination. When the student then access the unit, the unit portion of the book is clearly highlighted in the table of contents so it is clear which content is currently being taught. 

The student can still (unless explicitly disabled by the teacher/instructor) access other parts of the book for revision purposes.

### Limitations
There are certain things you can't do with a book that you might want to in a class context. For example, you might want to assign a coding project to a class that you can explicitly disable or that is only [enabled within a certain time-frame](/docs/teacher/classes/unit-duration/). Because a book has a single Codio box behind it, it is not possible to provide the isolation required to support this type of disabling. As a result, you should use standard project based units for such assignments.

Codio also offers the ability to run instructor authored scripts when a unit is completed. This also needs to be handled by a standard project based unit.

### Conclusion
In general, it is a good idea to put standard teaching materials and assessments into a Book and map corrsponding course units to the book and put lengthier coding assignments into a project based unit.

You may also want to use a book for storing a bank of assessments questions. You can nicely categorize your questions using the table of contents management. You can then create special assessment units that point to individual assessments that you choose using the unit-> book mapping ability.

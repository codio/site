It is important to understand how and why a book is published.

Until you publish a book, it behaves exactly as a project does. You can open it up and work with it but it cannot be accessed by anyone or mapped to a course until it has been published.

Please note the following about Publishing.

1. It creates a snapshot of the book and creates a published version. 
1. You can continue work on the book without affecting the published version.
1. When you map a course unit to a book, it will only pull from a published version, never the original book project itself.

### Later book modifications
If, after publishing, you make further changes to our book then you will need to publish again to ensure those changes are available to courses.


### Course mapping
A book cannot be assigned to a class without mapping it through a course. The advantage of this approach is that you can break your book into smaller chunks that map to lessons or lectures. 

You can map the entire book through a single course unit if you are not concerned about detailed unit mappings.

Please refer to [Creating book based course units](/docs/content/authoring/book/unit-book) page for details on how to do this. 


### Stack modifications

**** IAN : there is some important new functionality coming here on how to update or create a new stack from a book. Currently, Stacks does not allow you to source from a book (for some reason). The new functionality sorts this out. ****

In order to assign book content to a class, you first need to create a book unit. The advantage of this approach is that you can break your book into smaller chunks that map to lessons or lectures. Each of these chunks is a book based course unit. You can also map the entire book through a single course unit if you are not concerned about detailed unit mappings.

### Course setup
If you are not familiar with courses and modules, please [refer to the documentation](/docs/content/publish/course-overview). We will assume that you have created a course and a module within which you will create a new unit to map to a part of the book.

### Creating a new book based unit
Below is a screen shot of a course module, ready to have a new unit added.

Press the large blue **+** button to add a new unit. When you press it, you should specify **Book based unit**.

You should first select a book that you want to publish from the drop-down list. If you don't see your book here then check that you have published it. If the book is owned by someone else, then check that you have necessary permissions to access the book.

Next, you will need to select the book content that is mapped to this unit by pressing the **Change Content** button.

and then select the content from the book that you wish to be assigned to the unit

Finally, you should give your unit a name and optional description.

### Publishing the new unit
When you save the new unit settings, the unit is created but not yet published. This allows you to prepare or modify the course structure without it being available for assignment to students. Only when you publish it is it fully available to assign to a class.

When you create a unit, a snapshot is taken of the Codio project from which that unit is taken. If you make a change to the project, the unit is not automatically updated. This is to ensure that any edits you are making are not seen by students.

When you are ready to publish any edits, you will need to refresh the unit. You can do this it either of the following ways.

- Select the unit from the listing and then press the **Refresh Source** button.
- Toggle the **Edit Units** slider, and press the **Refresh Source** button that appears next to the unit.

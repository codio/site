Codio Books and Codio Authoring are powerful content authoring tools. Here are some key features.

- All content is written using simple markdown or HTML.
- HTML snippets can be embedded into any markdown page.
- Create a wide range of assessment questions, many of which are auto-graded.
- Students can easily reset their code experiments back to their original state.
- Create any number of sections within your content and chapters with sections nested to any depth.
- Optionally style your own output with CSS overrides.
- Specify files and terminal windows to automatically open for any individual page.
- Highlight code blocks within your code referenced from your Guide section.
- Choose from a selection of panel layouts for each page.
- Include guidance material for teachers that is not visible to students.

At the time of writing, the authoring table of contents management is different to books. However, we will unify this shortly.

- [Open and close files, terminal windows and html page previews](/docs/content/authoring/settings-actions/open-tabs/)
- [Launch commands](/docs/content/authoring/page-edit/inline/) from the content page and pipe terminal output into the content page
- Create manually and automatically graded [questions and assessments](/docs/content/authoring/assessments/)
- Manage a [table of contents](/docs/content/authoring/guides)

Codio has powerful authoring capabilities that let you create rich tutorial content. Here are a few of the key features.

- Each page of content can [control the layout of the IDE](/docs/content/authoring/layouts/)
- [Open and close files, terminal windows and html page previews](/docs/content/authoring/settings-actions/open-tabs/)
- [Launch commands](/docs/content/authoring/inline/) from the content page and pipe terminal output into the content page
- Create manually and automatically graded [questions and assessments](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/autograde)
- Manage a [table of contents](/docs/content/authoring/guides)

## Where is it?
You can launch the content authoring from 

- The menu, **Tools->Guide->Edit**
- The button at the top of the file tree as shown below

A Codio project can have a single Guide. Within that Guide you can have as many sections as you like.

To create a new Guide, or to edit an existing one, go to the 'Tools->Edit Guide' menu option.

Having selected 'Edit Guides' you will see your Guides window appear.

Use the Layout modes to switch between editor, preview,code and split view modes.

## Anatomy of the Guides Editor
Below is a screenshot of the editor with the main components highlighted.

- **[Theme](/docs/student/dyslexia/)** allows you to select the default theme for people viewing the Guide. We currently have a light theme and will be adding a dark theme shortly. (Dyslexic users can also choose a special theme from the Settings drop down in the Guide player.
- **[Scripts](/docs/content/authoring/buttons/)** allows you to point to one or more `.js` files in your project (usually you would have this somewhere within the `.guides` folder) that is run when the page is shown. This is especially useful when interacting with a Guide button.
- **[Lexicon Topic](/docs/content/courses/lexikon/)**  if you use this option, an icon will appear in the Guide toolbar that will load the Lexikon window with the selected topic automatically selected.
- **Suppress Page Numbering** allows you to suppress the section page numbers when in Play Mode.
- **Hide Menu** allows you to hide the main Codio menu items in the IDE (Codio/Project/File/Edit etc) when the unit is run in a [Class](/docs/teacher/classes/assign-project/).

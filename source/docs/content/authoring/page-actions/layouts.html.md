Codio allows you to choose from a variety of panel layouts for each section. This gives you great flexibility in the way you present Guides content and files to the student.

The layouts we currently offer can be found in the dropdown list.


Read the 'Specifying a panel' section here: [Auto opening files](/docs/content/authoring/auto-open) for information on how to reference these panels when auto opening code files, a preview window or a terminal window.

### Previous
The top most and default entry in the Layout dropdown is 'Previous'. This means it will use the same panel layout as specified in the previous section to save having to manually set it each time.

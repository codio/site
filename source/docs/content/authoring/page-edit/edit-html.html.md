## Setting HTML
You can specify that an individual page be authored using HTML from the Guides **Settings**. You will find the **Content type** dropdown where you can switch between HTML and Markdown.

## CSS header and footer
In order to style your content properly, you should use the **Edit HTML header** and **Edit HTML footer** settings. These can be found in the main **Settings** area on the **Global** tab.

The header and footer information wrap the HTML content for your page. Below is a typical example of a header.

```html
<html>  
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
		<title>bjlo2e_ch04-1</title>
		<link href=".guides/content/css/my-style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />    
		<script src="https://codio.com/codio-client.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src=".guides/content/script/my-script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	</head>

<body>
```

And here is the footer.

```html
</body>
</html>
```

## Support functions
In a Guides page authored using Markdown, you are able to create buttons and other actions. We provide some javascript functions that support the same functionality.

**Important** : if you use any of the functions listed below then you must load `https://codio.com/codio-client.js`in the HTML Header as shown in the example above.


- `codio.run(command, callback)` - Run a command on the box. `callback` will fire once executed and should be used to communicate back to the user. 
- `codio.runAndShow(command, outputElementId)` - Run a command on the box. All `stdout` will be displayed in `outputElementId`.  
- `codio.open('file', path, panel_num)` - Opens a file located in `path` in the `panel_num` panel, where `0` is the first panel from top left 
- `codio.open('terminal', command, panel_num)`-  Opens a terminal window and executes `command`. `panel_num` specifies the location of the panel, where `0` is the first panel from top left. 
- `codio.open('preview', url, panel_num)` - Opens a preview window at `url`. `panel_num` specifies the location of the panel, where `0` is the first panel from top left. 
- `codio.goToNextSection()` - Moves to the next page in the Guide. 
- `codio.goToPreviousSection()` - Moves to the previous page in the Guide. 
- `codio.switchUnit(unitId)` - Changes to a different Unit. The Unit ID is found by opening the Unit and getting the ID from the URL.

- `codio.assessments.check(assessmentId)` - Executes the assessment 
- `codio.assessments.reset(assessmentId)` - Resets any response and score that the user may have already provided for `assessmentId`. 
- `codio.assessments.get(assessmentId, callback)` - Gets the result data for a completed assessment 
- `codio.assessments.send(assessmentId, answer, points, callback)` - Sends result data for a custom assessment. `answer` contains the custom result data for `assessment` and will be stored in Codio. You can use `codio.assessments.get()` to reconstruct the output for an already answered question.

Your content will often want to show code samples. Codio's recommended approach is to put each set of code samples into a dedicated folder. Then, using the [Show Folders on page settings ](/docs/content/authoring/settings-actions/page#show-hide), you can specify this folder with the consequence that all non-specified folders are hidden from view in the file tree (if you choose to show it).

Latex is ideal for entering mathematical expressions into your pages. You can also insert Latex expressions into many assessment fields. Codio uses [Mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/) for the rendering of all Latex expressions, so certain macros are not supported. 

## Inline Latex expressions
An example of an inline expression is `$\frac{x^3+1}{x^2-1}$`. When your page is shown, the Latex expression will render appropriately.

## Display mode Latex expressions
You can also render one more more lines of Latex expressions in a more prominent format as shown below.

```
$$
y=x^2
\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}
$$
```

## Latex Resources
Google is often your friend when it comes to discovering Latex syntax. However, here are two very useful references that will accelerate things for you.

### Mathjax
[Here is a list](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#supported-latex-commands) of Latex commands supported by Mathjax.

### Stack Exchange
Here is a page on Math StackExchange that has an excellent overview of Mathjax/Latex syntax as well as explaining general concepts.

### Detextify
[Detextify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is an excellent way of finding a Latex symbol by free hand drawing it on the screen using your mouse or touchpad.

**Important:** you should not use commands that are not in the standard package. In the image above, you can see the last one has a \usepackage command. Symbols in a special package may not work.

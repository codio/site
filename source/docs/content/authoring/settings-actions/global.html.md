### Use Mark as Complete
For a discussion on the use of the this feature, please [click here](/docs/content/authoring/assessments/submitcomplete).

This setting is enabled by default and will show students a button at the end of the unit, from their [dashboard](/docs/dashboard/student/myclassroom/) and from **Education** menu in the IDE they can select to mark as complete.

If you have set the [Unit Duration](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/unit-duration/) 'On Unit End' action to mark as complete or disable and mark as complete, the unit will automatically be marked as complete when the end date/time of the unit is reached and you can elect to suppress the ability for students to have to mark their units as complete by disabling this setting.


### Use Submit Buttons

If you have set the [Unit Duration](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/unit-duration/), when the end of unit duration date/time is reached, all answers to the assessments will be automatically submitted

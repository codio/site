You can control information that appears in the content in the two following ways. 

## Warning
For the content to be properly hidden, the project must be opened as a unit within a course module. 

If your project is public and a user accesses this project via the public listing of your account then they will have access to the solutions.

## Entire page
If you want a page and its appearance in the table of contents to be only visible to a teacher, then you should set the **Teacher Only** slider in the page settings to on.

## Selected content within page
If you want to hide a certain piece of information from students then you should include all such content within a page within `|||guidance ..... |||`. An example is shown below.

```
|||guidance
### Solution
This solution will only be shown

- to teachers
- provided the content is published within a unit
- if you share a project normally or it is public and a student loads it, they have access to this content.

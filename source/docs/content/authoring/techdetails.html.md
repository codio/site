All your guides content is stored in the `content` folder in the `.guides` folder.

> **Important :** do not edit your files from this folder. Always use the Guide editor. If you mess things up by editing files directly, then you may have a tough job getting it back on its feet again.

## Images
It is recommended that you place your images in the `.guides/img` folder, although you don't have to.

## Other Guides related files
The goal should generally be to keep all extra files you may use for your Guides specific operations in the `.guides` folder. This way, the rest of your workspace area will appear clean and tidy and empty of rubbish for the student.

In Play mode, the `.guides` folder and the `.codio` files are hidden from view.

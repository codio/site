## Chapters, sections and pages
A guide is comprised of pages organized into chapters and sections. A chapter is a top level item only. Sections can be placed at any location and nested to any depth.

You can add a new chapter, section or page by

- right clicking on the appropriate location within the table of contents.
- by first selecting the item in the table of contents below which the new element should be added and then pressing one of the buttons underneath the table of contents.

## Adding content to a chapter or section
By default, chapters and sections are passive and do not have page content assigned to them. However, you can add content by right-clicking the item and then selecting **Add content** from the menu.

If you want to reverse the procedure, you right click and select **Remove content**.

## Multiple selection
You can multi-select pages as follows

- Select an item then `shift+click` on a latter item to select all pages between the two items. This only works for items at the same level.
- Use `ctrl+click` (PC/Linux) or  `cmd+click` (Mac) to multi select individual pages.

## Drag and Drop
It is very important to understand how drag and drop works within a table of contents as it is very powerful but can be confusing if you donâ€™t understand that drop process. Drag and drop works with individual or multiple selected pages.

What is unusual about our drag and drop support is that the destination folder location is determined by where you drop.

- If you drop in the top portion of the target item, the selection will be dropped above it at the same level.
- If you drop in middle portion of the target item, the selection will be dropped within it if the target is a section.
- If you drop in the lower portion of the target item, the selection will be dropped below the target at the same level.

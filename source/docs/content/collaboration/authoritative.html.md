Although Codio has open sourced its own content, we also strongly support the creation of your own content which you then publish for others to collaborate on.

### Codio Content
Codio's content can be found on GitHub. The best place to start is 

- [https://github.com/codio-content/Information/wiki](https://github.com/codio-content/Information/wiki)

This Wiki contains full details of the Courses and Units that we have published and open sourced. 

### Your own content
Should you wish to create your own content, then you should publish them to your own GitHub repos in a similar way. [Click here](/docs/content/collaboration/create-repo) to see how to create your own GitHub repos and link them to your Codio projects.

Once created, others will be able to follow the same steps described in this chapter of the documentation.

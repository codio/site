You should create repos for each Codio project (Unit) you want to collaborate on. There is no single button press way of creating a GitHub repo from a Codio project. The steps are explained below and you can also watch the video.

1. Make sure your code is committed to your local repo.
1. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo. 
1. In Codio, set up Git to point to this *remote* using `git remote add origin git@github.com:yourgitusername/test.git`
1. Push your changes to the remote using `git push -u origin master`

That's all. Now you can check your GitHub repo and you will find your code there. 

After using `git push -u origin master` for the first time, you only need to use `git push`.

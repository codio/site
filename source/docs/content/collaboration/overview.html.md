While it is possible to give permissions to a project unit and a book from within the project itself, **there are risks of corrupted metadata files and should therefore be avoided**. 

### Git
Git is a standard part of the development process. As well as being an excellent collaboration tool, it also allows you to take full advantage of its version control capabilities, so you can roll back to earlier states (commits).

Git is very effective in managing Codio content in a collaborative situation. For those new to Git, here's why ...

- It snapshots your work at any point in time.
- You can roll your code back (and forward) to any past snapshot.
- You can create 'branches' of your code and content that contain different experiments while leaving the main, 'master' branch in its production state. Once tested, you can merge your experimental branch back into the main branch.
- It allows several people to work on the exact same project independently without risk of messing up your project.
- When you merge your work with other people's, it knows what is safe to merge and where there might be a conflict on the exact same lines of code or text, prompting you to resolve the issue.

For those who have used Git previously, there is no need to read on. You can access the command line, initialize a Git repo and go from there.

In the following section, we will explore how to use Codio and Git together to enable any level of collaboration between any number of people. This is not intended to be an tutorial on Git but it shows standard use cases in Codio.

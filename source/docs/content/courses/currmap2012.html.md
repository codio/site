Codio's teaching content has been created in partnership with the UK's leading examination board, Oxford & Cambridge and RSA (OCR).

It has been designed specifically to cover the entirety of the coding aspects of the current GCSE curriculum as well as the new (2016) curriculum.

Additionally, you can find content covering the non-coding aspects of the pre 2016 curriculum with non-coding coverage for the new 2016 curriculum due in early Q3 2015.

## Curriculum Map for the OCR GCSE 2012 Computing Specification (J275 Version 1 April 2012)

Please view our [Curriculum Map](https://docs.google.com/a/codio.com/spreadsheets/d/1fGg1ouSMPuYuZwckQVlGGvMkz2d8K-N1EmJotMx-GJ8/edit?usp=sharing) for the OCR GCSE 2012 Computing Specification (J275 Version 1 April 2012). This powerful spreadsheet showcases our excellent curriculum coverage and commitment to teaching Computing.

### Creating Lesson Plans: How to use the Curriculum Map

The curriculum map is your resource to track and plan your lesson time. We recommend a minimum (Column C) and maximum (Column D) number of lessons for each curriculum area. Columns F-I specify the Codio content that covers the specific curriculum area.

You can use the spreadsheet by entering time spent and planned for your lessons in Column E. The total amount of time is added up and shown in cell E167. This gives you the confidence to know that all curriculum areas are covered. See the accompanying [Instructional Document](https://docs.google.com/a/codio.com/document/d/144LEfE9tmy67w0bWZL-Mf_8Ibjeyg9SvC-umdv9Ummo/edit?usp=sharing) to the Curriculum Map for further guidance. (The curriculum map outlines 2 years of GCSE Computing work with an expected 3 lesson per week and 34 weeks per year. There is a total of 204 lessons.)

## Curriculum Map for the OCR GCSE (9-1) Computer Science Draft Specification (J276 Version 1)

Please view our [Curriculum Map](https://docs.google.com/a/codio.com/spreadsheets/d/12yqcyCNh4Tt2gtXt8RR0Qt1viWytIcjdAgWUZnGEEUs/edit?usp=sharing) for the OCR GCSE (9-1) Computer Science Draft Specification (J276 Version 1).

Interpreting detailed specifications like the OCR J275 and J276 or a higher level specification like the GCSE Computer Science specification from the Department for Education can be a daunting task. Our curriculum maps are the best way for teachers to put the these specifications into practice and teach with confidence. You can find the curriculum maps under the description tab of the relevant courses ands modules.

To start using the OCR J276 curriculum map with your class see the accompanying [Instructional Document](https://docs.google.com/a/codio.com/document/d/1UdsW9E-neoGuzMH_uwKTdZTe980aw_7rc9OeWN_BAvI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Course summary
Codio's teaching materials take a rigorous approach to teaching coding. As well as extensive tutorial content, you will also find a large number of challenge assessments.

Both content and assessments have been carefully built to gradually increase the difficulty level, ensuring that knowledge and confidence are built up one step at a time. This approach is important to avoid demotivating students.

You will find the following courses

### An Introduction to Programming
This introduces students to the basic concepts of programming, first using [Flode](/docs/content/courses/flode) before moving on to coding with Javascript, Python and/or Java. You will find many auto-graded coding assessments within each unit as well as a module dedicated to challenges. We also have a module introducing more advanced searching and sorting algorithms.

### MySQL
The first module covers the requirements of the GCSE curriculum. However, we also are offering more advanced materials covering accessing of databases through code as well as database design. These latter units are well suited as stretch materials or those wanting to build web applications or pursue coding at a higher level.

### Crunch
Crunch is a modern and very easy to use equivalent of Little Man Computer. It comes with both a proper debugger and a visualisation feature that teaches the fetch/execute cycle and shows how CPUs work when executing a program. As with all our units, this content comes with a large number of automated assessments.

### An Introduction to Web Development
Although HTML and CSS are not mandated in the GCSE curriculum, OCR and Codio consider it a very valuable skillset and something that should be taught to students who are starting computing early enough. We are seeing many teachers in the UK teaching this and this course aims to support teachers who are new to this material as well as those with some experience. 

As well as teaching the mechanics of building web pages, it also takes the Javasript knowledge acquired through the Introduction to Programming course and applies it to web pages to teach the basics of dynamic web sites and web applications.

### Linux Command Line Interface
This course teaches students how to access the terminal and access the Linux command line interface. 

### Cambridge MOOC - Non-Coding
This course is a port of OCR's Cambridge MOOC and covers the non-coding aspects of the pre 2016 GCSE curriculum. It contains the tutorial content, videos as well as auto-marked assessment questions.

Please view our [Curriculum Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1of2dwHnwWigE9-SWtD7c40vBD0KmrVXiKWn-gZOnR2Q/edit?usp=sharing) for the CSTA Middle School.

The goals of this course are to engage students in using computational thinking as a problem solving tool, teach them to use programming concepts and methods while creating digital artifacts, and retain their interest in computing as a relevant and exciting field. 

Learning opportunities are presented in ways that are active, connected, and relevant to them, and promote the perception of themselves as proactive and empowered problem solvers, creators, and innovators capable of changing the world. Collaborative learning experiences at this level prepare students to work in teams and to build supportive partnerships.

Codio’s extensive curriculum content has been designed with students and teachers in mind. Our courses are suitable for all age ranges, and will allow your learners to progress at a pace appropriate to their individual needs. As a school user of Codio, you and your students get access to all of our curriculum content for as long as your subscription lasts.

It is up to individual teachers how they feel the content is best used, be it to deliver the curriculum, support the teaching of new concepts, for exam revision purposes, or as a home study tool. Below is quick run-down of our content broadly categorised into appropriate age ranges. You will notice there is some overlap - depending on individual situations and previous experience much of our content can be widely used.

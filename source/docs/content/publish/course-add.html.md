## Adding a course
You can add a Course from the main Course listing screen by pressing the **New Course** button at the top right of the screen.

## Creating a module
If you already have a module that is attached to another course, then you can search for this as explained below.

If, however, you want to create a new module to add your units to, then you can create one by pressing the **Create Module** button. If you do not see this, press the **Edit Modules** slider to make these buttons visible.

## Adding a Module
It is possible to add modules to your course that are already in use in another course. Press the **Add Module** button. If you do not see this, press the **Edit Modules** slider to make this buttons visible.

The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add. 

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

You can also order the list of modules by name or owner and use the 'Filter by Course' drop down to view modules in other courses.

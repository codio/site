A course is always made up on at least one module. A module contains the individual units that students interact with. Modules help you organize your units into logical groupings. If your course only contains a few units then you may want only a single module. If, on the other hand, your course has a large number of units, then dividing them up may make more organizational sense.

## Creating a module
To create a new, empty module, press the **Create Module** button. You can also re-use a module that is located in another course as explained below.

## Name, Descriptions, Image & Tags
You are required to enter a name for your module. The Short Description is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.

A Long Description is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your course.

You should also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image is also suggested.

## Visibility
This determines whether your module is publicly available to all Codio users or should remain private to you and/or your [Organization](/docs/teacher/create/adminrole/) (if you are a member of an Organization). 

To publish your module to an Organization, please read on.

## Owner
By default, you are the owner of the module you create.

If you are a member of an Organisation, the Organisation owner can disable the ability for you to create public modules. See [Public/Private Settings](/docs/teacher/create/public_private).

If you select an Organization from the 'Who should own this module' dropdown, then 

1. Any Owner group members of that Organization are able to administer the module.
2. All Organization members will be able to see it in the listing, even if the module is marked as private. 

To create a module that is private to your Organization, select the Private option and select the Organization as the owner.

## Adding a Module
It is possible to add a module to your course that already exists in another course. Press the **Add Module** button. 
The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add. 

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

You can also order the list of modules by name or owner and use the 'Filter by Course' drop down to view modules in other courses.

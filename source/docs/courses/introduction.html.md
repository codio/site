The most basic way to assign content to students is to create a project and then [assign the project to the class](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/assign-project). Over time, you may end up with a lot of projects in your project list. Each time you come to teach your course, you will find it harder and harder to locate the right project when you need it.

Courses is a very elegant way of managing your projects. A course has a very simple hierarchy.

- **Course**: this is the top level and is just a top level name.
- **Module**: a module is a grouping for your main project units. If you have 50 project units in your course then you might want to put several units into distinct modules.
- **Unit**: a unit is a Codio project that is a unit of teaching. It is entirely up to you how much or little is covered in a unit. A common approach is to assign about one lesson or lecture's worth of material into a single unit.

A course unit typically takes one of two forms.

- **Tutorial**: in this case you would use the [Codio Guides](/docs/content/authoring/guides) or [Codio Books](/docs/books/) tutorial authoring tools to create your tutorial content. [Click here](/docs/content/authoring/3ways) for an overview of the difference.
- **Assignment**: in this case you create a project unit where everything is set up for the student to tackle a coding assignment or challenge. You can still use Guides or Books to give instructions, but the general idea is to code rather than learn.

The above two cases are not fixed concepts in Codio but are typical use cases. You can do whatever you like with a project unit.

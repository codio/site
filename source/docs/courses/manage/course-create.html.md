## Name, Descriptions, Image & Tags
You are required to enter a name for your course. The Short Description is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.

A **Long Description** is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your course. This field support markdown.

You can also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image icon is also suggested.

## Other settings
Please refer to the [next page](/docs/courses/manage/course-add/) for information on how to control access to courses and modules.

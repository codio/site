When you create a course in Codio, it is private so is visible to you only.

However, if you set your course to be public, it becomes available for any other Codio user to find in the **All** tab of the listings.

You can make a course public at course creation or by pressing the **Edit** button having selected the course from the listing.

To publish a course only to your organization, please refer to [Creating a Course](/docs/courses/manage/course-create)

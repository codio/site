If you want to collaborate on project units or books, then you should use Git. Two users should not simultaneously edit the same authored content due to possible corruption issues. 

The best way to manage this and to incorporate source control management at the same time is to use Git. Authored content works very nicely with Git on a page by page basis.

There can occasionally be issues arising from conflicts within the `books.json` file and these will need to be resolved by hand.

### Editing a book unit
If you want to edit book unit content, then you need to edit the book itself. You would then republish the book after which you will see **Update to latest version** in the unit listing.

If you have added new content then you can also remap the unit to the book as described on the [adding a unit](/docs/courses/units/unit-add#createbook) page.


### Editing a project unit
Editing a project unit is always done from the unit itself.  Select the unit to open the unit in the IDE.

If there is a later version of the unit that has been published, you will see the following screen and elect to open either the latest published version or the last version you edited.

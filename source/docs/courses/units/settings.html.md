Additional actions for the unit are available by clicking on the 3 vertical blue dots. You will get a different menu depending on whether you have a book unit or a project unit.

For book units, you will not see **Change stack** or **Versions**.


### Edit settings

For project units, select **Edit settings** to change the unit title, description and icon.

For book units, you can also remap the unit to the book contents.


### Versions
This allows you to view the version history. You can see

- date/time when the unit was published,
- name of the person who published the unit,
- the name and version of the stack assigned to the unit.

### Change stack
This option is only available for project units. It allows you to switch the stack used by a unit. 

If a stack is set to **Use latest version** then

- when a unit has been assigned to a class, any student who has not yet started the unit will use the latest version of the stack.
- the unit itself will remain on whatever stack version was last assigned. If you want to change it to the latest created stack version then you should click the **Save Changes** button to update it.

## Delete unit

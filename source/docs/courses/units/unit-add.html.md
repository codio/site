A unit behaves like a Codio project except it will not appear in your projects list. This allows you to create and manage course based content solely within the Courses area.

If you have a regular project that you want to convert into a unit, then the process is described below.

## Adding a new unit
You add a new unit by pressing the large blue **+** button. You now need to choose between 

- a project unit
- a book unit

[Click here](/docs/content/authoring/3ways) if you are not sure about the difference between project units and book units.


### New project unit
You can create a new unit in the following ways.

- Create a brand new unit as you would with a normal Codio project.
- Import an existing project into the unit. See the image below and read the contents of the **Important** box. A snapshot of the selected project is taken. From that point on you will edit from the unit, not the project.
- Import from other sources such as GitHub/BitBucket/Mercurial etc. by selecting the **Import** option.

### New book unit
Creating a new book unit involves pointing to the parts of a book that you want to map to your unit. You will seen the following screen.

<img alt="Book Unit" src="/img/docs/newbook.png" class="simple"/>

You can now 

- specify the book you want to reference
- select the parts of the book you want to include in this unit
- give the unit a name.

With book units, students can look at any part of the book even when assigned a single unit. This is ideal for referring back to material covered previously and for general revision and can be set in the class. See [Book Visibility](/docs/classes/classmanagement/bookvisibility)] for more information.

### Important
The upgrading process described on this page will only effect content contained within the `/.guides` folder, which is where your authored tutorial content is located. Changes in all other locations will not be passed on to classes. 

If you need to make a complete update, then you have to [reset the unit](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/reset-unit/) in the class. This will retrieve the full unit, not just the `/.guides` folder. However any work done by students on that unit will be lost and will need to be restarted.

### Upgrade procedure
If you make changes to your authored tutorial content and assessments and require that these be passed through, then you should

- publish a new version of the unit if it is a project unit, or
- update to the latest version of the book for a book unit.

This will not change units that have already been assigned to a class. To do so, you should go to the class and upgrade the course from the class. If you have updated the course, then you will see the following screen in your class.

When you press the button, you will see the following screen, which shows you which units have been modified. You can then select the units that you want to update.

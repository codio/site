You may need to make changes to a unit that has already been assigned to a class. 

If this is the case then, having made changes in your project unit or book, you should

- publish a new version of the unit if it is a project unit, or
- update to the latest version of the book for a book unit

This will not change units that have already been assigned to a class. To do so, you should go to the class and upgrade the course from the class. This is [described here](IAN). 

To update the unit in the Class select **[Upgrade Course](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse)** button showing in the class, or from the 3 blue vertical dots to the right of the unit listed in the class. See [Update Unit](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/updateunit) for more on this.

You should be aware that only the contents of the `.guides` folder will be updated in order to retain any student work that may have already started.

If you have made more substantial changes to the main code workspace and you require that the students have their unit reset then, after publishing, select the [Reset unit](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/reset-unit/) option from the class. You should be aware that any student work already started will be lost.

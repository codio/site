Working with courses often follows the pattern listed below.

### Setup

1. **Create a new course** and name it.
1. **Create your first module**. You need at least one module to hold your units. A module is an organizational item and a) contains units and b) can be assigned to a class with all its units.

### Unit Creation

Either

- **Create a new project unit**  this gives you a dedicated Codio box and behaves like a regular Codio project.

Or

- **Create a new book unit** which maps to a part of a book. Unlike project units, a book has a single Codio box to work with along with a typically large volume of content. 

Please [click here](/docs/content/authoring/3ways) for details on how to decide whether to use project units or book units


### First version
This describes the first time you create a new unit.

1. **Edit your unit**. If your unit is a project unit, clicking the unit will take you into the IDE, as with a Codio project, where you can work on your project. 
1. **Publish your unit**. When you think your unit is in good shape, it is ready to publish. A unit is not available to the course until you publish. At this point a snapshot is taken of the unit and it forms a part of the published course.
1. **Assign module to class**. Once you have units published, you may want to [assign them to a class](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/assign-module).

You will iterate through the above process as you add more units to your course modules.


### Updates
Editing a unit **does not affect published course content or content assigned to classes**. This section describes how you can push your changes out to courses and classes when you are ready.

1. **More edits to a unit**. After publishing, you may decide to make further changes. These changes do not form a part of the published course unit until you republish, so you can edit without concern for altering published content. 
1. **Republish**. Having made more changes, you can publish the unit again in order to make those changes available to the course. However, publishing does not update units previously assigned to a class.
1. **Update class**. If you had assigned a course module to a class and subsequently updated and published a unit within that module, then units within that module are not automatically updated in the class. You need to explicitly do this by going to the class. You should see a red [**Update Course** button](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse). This allows you to selectively update units.

You are required to enter a **Name** for your class. The **Description** is optional but we strongly recommend providing a detailed description to help students find the correct class and to clearly differentiate from others. 

##Organization
If you only belong to one Organization then this will be pre-populated. If you belong to more than one Organization then be careful to select the appropriate one.

##Begin & End Dates
These are purely for display purposes and are optional.

##Modules, Teachers & Students
Having created your Class you can at this point proceed to add modules, teachers and students to the class.

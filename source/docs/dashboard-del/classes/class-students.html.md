Once you have selected a class, you can add students in 2 ways.

Either click on the **Admin** menu item as shown below.

To add students, who are Codio users already, you can send them the 'Class Token' that they can then enter in the 'Join a Class' area in their dashboard and they will then be added automatically into this class.

Or go to the **Students** tab, press `Edit` and `Add Student` where a pop up will appear and you can search for the students (you can also filter by organisation if your students are already members of your organisation) to add them or use the `Class Token` in the same manner as above.

**Please Note**: You can regenerate the class token at any time but any users who were previously sent the original token will not be able to use that old token.

If they are not already members of Codio see [here](/docs/dashboard/organizations/adding-members/) for more options.


You can remove students by going to the **Students** tab, press `Edit` and then the **X** button next to a student name.

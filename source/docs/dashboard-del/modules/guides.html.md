A Guide is a way of providing rich tutorial content to the student. Codio Guides allow you to write rich, multi section content using simple markdown. It's incredibly easy.

The student sees the content in one Codio IDE pane and can navigate between instruction steps. Meanwhile, another pane(s) is used to write your code.

Not only can you structure your content into sections, but the Guide can automatically open and close code files as well as run terminal commands.

All Module Units require some basic Guide content.

Please refer to the [Guides documentation](/docs/tuts/author/) for full details.

Only Module owners or those with administration permissions may modify units.

Let's say you have created a unit and then you decide you want to update the Codio project associated with that unit. 

You can edit the source Codio project by opening it from your normal Codio projects list. Alternatively, if you are viewing the Unit in the Modules list, you can open it by clicking on Module, enable the 'Edit Units' toggle button and then the select the unit and press the `Edit Original` button.

From the same screen, click the `Refresh Source` button to update the unit from the source project.

You should be aware that if you have created a [class](/docs/dashboard/classes) and assigned that module to that class then any modifications will not be seen by the class.

We offer the following special arrangements for schools, universities, colleges and other teaching organizations.

##Educational Organization Trial
Schools, universities and colleges can trial the full Codio experience free for 30 days with up to 100 students. Please go to the [Trialing Codio](/docs/teacher/trial/) section for instructions.

##Education Discounts
Education institutions benefit from a discount structure designed to make a Codio "whole school" licence affordable for large user groups.

For example, an annual school licence attracts a starting discount of almost 90% versus the annualised cost of a professional developer subscription, with further discounts available dependent on the size of your school group.

Universities and other higher education institutions achieve discounts of approximately 50% or greater.

You can explore Codio school and university prices and start an education trial by visiting our [pricing](/pricing) page.

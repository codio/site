Users with a personal Codio subscription can be brought into an Organizational account as follows

- Cancel the personal subscriptions. This will temporarily disable any private Projects.
- Create your Organization in Codio and then add the others to the 'All Members' group. At this point, any disabled private projects will be re-enabled as active private Projects

If you are working in groups or are a school, college or university, we recommend you create an Organization. Schools/Colleges or Universities can request a trial from the [Organisations](/docs/dashboard/organizations/create/) page. 

Currently, the main advantage of an Organization account is 

- Access to [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classes/)
- Teachers and Students can create private Projects, Stacks, Starter Packs and Courses
- Generate an Invitation Token to send out to your users for then to sign up and automatically join your organisation
- Upload a CSV file of your users for them to receive an email and be able to sign up, join your organisation and also automatically assign students into [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classes/)


We will be adding futher functionality here to support student driven assignment to classes, collaboration and other advanced features.

##Subscriptions and Trials
We offer very substantial Organization discounts to schools and universities. We also offer Codio for free in certain special situations.

To apply for a trial, head to the [Organisations](/docs/dashboard/organizations/create/) section and click on the Education link.

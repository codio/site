## Bookstores
Some institutions may provide Codio licenses via the bookstore. Your course instructor or course syllabus will specify if this is available at your particular school. 

A single license can be used for a specified timeframe - 1 semester (5 months), 2 semesters (10 months) or a year. Specific licenses options may depend on your local bookstore.


Purchasing a license

To purchase a license, you can request the following from your bookstore

	1 Semester  - Codio 1-Semester Subscription - ISBN: 978-1-7331872-5-1
	2 Semesters - Codio 2 Semester Subscription ISBN 978-1-73331872-8-2
	Annual - Codio Annual Subscription ISBN # 978-1-7331872-1-3


Your bookstore will provide you with a sheet that contains a code that can be used to activate your subscription for the specified timeframe. 

NOTE: A single subscription can be used for multiple courses using Codio during the specified timeframe.


#### Activating a bookstore license

title: "Student consent form"
---

The student consent form is a feature for Codio organizations. It allows you to show an IP consent form, whose content you create yourself, to Codio users. 

To configure the consent form information, click on your user name from the dashboard. Next, select your organization. You will then see the **IP Consent** tab at the top of the screen.

If you enable this feature, all students will be shown the form when they first create an account. If a student has already created an account then the next time they sign in, they will be shown the form. They will not be able to access Codio until they do consent.

### Creating content

You should first create the content that you wish to display to the student. You enter your text in the lower portion of the screen. You can use markdown to format your text. If you are not familiar with markdown, here are a couple of references for markdown

You can press the **Save Draft** button to save your changes and continue editing later.

You can also **Preview** your changes to see how the rendered output appears.

### Publishing and revisions
You need to publish your changes so that they appear to the student. You can create new versions over time. Earlier versions of the form can be recalled by selecting the version from the drop down list.

Once you are happy with your text, you press the **Publish new version** button. 

### Exporting student consent data
If you would like to download a log of all students who have consented, press the **Download CSV** link in the upper section.

The CSV file contains the following data

- User name
- Codio user ID
- Email address
- Revision of the consent form they consented to
- Date and time of the consent.

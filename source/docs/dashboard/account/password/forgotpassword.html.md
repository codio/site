title: "Forgot your password"

---


If you have forgotten your password, you should use the **lost password** link on the log-in page to reset your password automatically via email. 

**For School and University students only:** If you do not have access to the email address you used in creating your Codio account and you are a student, please contact your teacher. He or she will be able to reset your password for you.

If you wish to change your password (you should also do this if you forgot your password and it was reset) follow these steps:

1. Click on your name and gravatar (bottom left of screen)

1. From the options along the top of the page, choose **Account**

1. About halfway down the **Account** page is the **Change Password** area. The student should enter their new password, and then click **Update password**.

1. This will then send an email to your registered email addresss containing a link for you to click. Clicking on this link will then send you another email containing the new password you can then use to login.

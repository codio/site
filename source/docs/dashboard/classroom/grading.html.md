Once students have completed their assignments, they should notify the teacher of completion by going to the 'Education->Mark as completed' menu item. 

The teacher can select a class and drill down to a module to see all students who have been assigned that module. Students that have completed the module will have a check mark showing.

At this point, the teacher will probably [review the code](/docs/dashboard/classroom/view-student-code) and then assign comments and ultimately a grade.

To assign comments or a grade, you click on the pencil icon (see below). You can then modify the comments and grade fields for any individual student.

The student will be able to see this when they view this information in the classes/module screen.

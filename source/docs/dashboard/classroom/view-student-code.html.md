The teacher can inspect the 'students' code when completed by selecting a class and then a module within that class. You then will see the list of students who were assigned that module and for those that have completed you can then view their code.

To take a look at the code of any individual student, just click the right most icon. The student's project will open up in a new browser tab and you are able to review their code and also make modifications if you require.

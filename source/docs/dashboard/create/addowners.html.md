You are the **Owner** of your organization if you created it. You can add other owners (these will usually be other teachers who you wish to give admin rights to).
There are 2 ways you can do this:

### Add a new user to your Organisation Owners group

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="Profile" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organisations**)
<img alt="Org Name" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the **Members** tab 
<img alt="Members" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/memberstab.png" class="simple"/>

1. In the  **Invite Teacher to the Organization** area, enter in their Email address and check the 'Add this teacher to owners group'.
<img alt="Invite Owner" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/inviteowner.png" class="simple"/>

1. An email will be sent to your colleague containing a link to sign up and on completion they will be added into your Organisation automatically and to the **Owners** group.
**N.B.** They must use the email address the invitation was sent to or they will not be added to the Organisation.

1. Any invitations not completed will show in the area below and where you can also 'Resend' or 'Revoke' if you require. Once the invitee has joined the organisation they will no longer show in this area but show in the **All Members** list below and also **Owners** list.

### Add an existing Codio user to your Organisation Owners group

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="Profile" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen. 
<img alt="Org Name" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the **Members** tab
<img alt="Members" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/memberstab.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click **Owners**
<img alt="Owners" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/owners.png" class="simple"/>

You should see yourself listed as an owner. To add another teacher, choose the **Add User** drop down and as you type their Codio Username, the listing will filter down so you can then select them.

You do not add students to an organization directly. They are added by inviting them to join a class. Please [click here](/docs/classes/classmanagement/addstudents) for more information.

Codio also creates test students so instructors are able to see how students interact with a class. This is described in the class section.

If you are using an LMS for a class then the LMS platform will handle the addition of students to the Codio class automatically.

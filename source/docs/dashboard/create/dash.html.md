Organisation owners can manage the student dashboard view by setting their default page to 'My Projects' as an alternative to **My Classroom** as well as optionally hiding **My Classroom** and **Courses** menu items.

To do this, access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Classes**)

1. Click the name of your institution (under **My Organizations**)
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>
1. You will see admin options listed across the top of the page.

**N.B.** Your students may need to reload Codio in their browser when they next log in for the changes to be visible to them

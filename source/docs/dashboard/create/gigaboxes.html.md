Codio's default boxes are allocated 512MB of memory. If you need larger boxes then you can upgrade your subscription to give access to 1GB and 2GB boxes.

You purchase a specific number of Gigaboxes that can be used by anyone within your organization. Codio tracks usage based on active projects rather than total projects. In other words, you can have 100 projects which use a Gigabox but as long as only one is active at a time, this requires only a single Gigabox unit to be purchased.

To see the status of your current Gigabox usage, for all users

- Click on your user name in the dashboard
- Select your organization 
- Click on the Organization Settings tab

You can then scroll down to the Gigaboxes section.

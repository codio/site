Organisation owners can enable this feature to disable members of the Organisation from creating Public Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules. These will be then created as Private.

Private projects can still be shared to other users in the normal manner. See [Permissions](/docs/ide/customization/permissions/)


**N.B.** Any existing Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules created by members of the organisation will not be effected

Sometimes you might need to check who is registered as a member of your educational organization. To view all members of your school ‘organization’ follow these steps:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen. 
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the **Members** tab

1. Click **All Members**
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/members.png" class="simple"/>

You will be able to see all the members of your school ‘organisation’.

The **Test Students** group contains the demo student accounts created for you when the Organisation was created. See [Create Organisation](/docs/teacher/create/) for more information.

The **Users without class** group contains all users that are not members of a class. See [Delete Class](/docs/teacher/classes/delete/) for more information.  This may be as a result of a class being deleted or it may be that a new user has joined your organisation but is not yet either a Teacher or a Student in a class.
Select this group and you can then remove these users from your organisation if required.

Please note that removing users from your Organisation does not delete their Codio account. Only the account owner can [delete their account](/docs/account/delete/).

Codio Stacks lets you create and manage the combination of a Codio Box and installed system level components (languages, databases, web servers etc.) so that you can instantly create new Projects and Boxes from Stack libraries.

![Stacks List](/img/docs/stacks_list.png)

Stacks are divided up into the following searchable areas within the Stacks listing

- **My Stacks** are Stacks that were created by you.
- **Certified Stacks** are Stacks that are approved by Codio and cover a wide range of common stack configurations.
- **Popular Stacks** are the most commonly downloaded, publicly available stacks created by other Codio users; you should note that Codio does not warrant that these Stacks are tested or safe.
- **All Stacks** gives you a searchable repository of all Stacks, whether created by you, others as well as Codio Certified Stacks.

If you cannot find a Stack that meets your needs, then you can configure your own Stack and add it to your Stack library [as described here](/docs/dashboard/stacks/new).

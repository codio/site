Having created a new Stack, you may later want to update the Stack properties or take another Stack snapshot from a Codio project.

TODO:Image

To update the Stack, first select it from the Stack list and then press the edit icon, as shown in the image above.

You can update your Stack from any Codio project. In the **Source** field you can select the Codio project to update your Stack from. 

You can also assign it an optional version number along with some comments describing the changes you have made. The new Stack details along with the date and time of your Stack update will be added to the Changelog screen.

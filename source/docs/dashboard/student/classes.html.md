title: "Joining a class as a student"

---

Your teacher can invite you to join classes that have been set up. This allows you to access the specific curriculum-mapped content and projects that have been assigned to you.


Here is how you would join a class:

1. If your teacher has sent you an Invitation URL, copy/paste that into your browser.

1. If your teacher has sent you a 2 word token, go to **[Join Class](https://codio.com/p/join-class)** button on our website and enter the class token.

1. To access your class in future, log in to your Codio account and go to the [My Classroom](/docs/dashboard/student/myclassroom) area

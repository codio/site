title: "Joining a class as a student"

---

Your teacher can invite you to join classes that have been set up. This allows you to access the specific curriculum-mapped content and projects that have been assigned to you.


Here is how you would join a class:

1. Go to **[Join Class](https://codio.com/p/join-class)** button on our website and enter the class token that your teacher has given you

1. To access your class in future, log in to your Codio account and go to the [My Classroom](/docs/student/myclassroom) area

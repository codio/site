When your work has been graded and released by your class instructor, you will see 'graded' showing in your dashboard

<img alt="graded work" src="/img/docs/graded.png" class="simple"/>

To view details of the grades given, either open the project and go to Education>Feedback

<img alt="feedback" src="/img/docs/feedback.png" class="simple"/>

or click on the 'Grade' field showing in the dashboard

<img alt="access grades" src="/img/docs/accessgrades.png" class="simple"/>

Click on 'details' for the assessment and you can drill down to see more information on that assessment

<img alt="grade detail" src="/img/docs/gradedetail.png" class="simple"/>

**Note** If the project has been marked as completed, you can click on the 'completed' button to access the grade feedback but if you wish to view the project, click on the name of the project on the left hand side. As the unit is completed you will not be able to edit anything but can view the content

If your organisation uses an LMS system a URL of the grading detail will also be passed to your LMS that you can access from the grading area.

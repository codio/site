### Restore Current Files
Sometimes you might make changes to your work that you don’t like or that you don’t want to keep. 

The easiest way to get rid of these is to restore the original files in a unit. 
To do this:

1. Open the unit you are working on. In the top right, choose the settings icon, and then **Restore current files**
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/guides/reset.png" class="simple"/>

<a name="completed"></a>

### Completing Units

When you have completed a unit you can mark it as completed. This can be done from either:

- Your [My Classroom](/docs/dashboard/student/myclassroom/) area
- In the settings (click the gear icon)
	<img alt="Complete" src="/img/docs/guides/complete.png" class="simple"/>
- From the last page in the guide.

If you mark a unit as complete in error, discuss with your class instructor/teacher who can reset the unit so you can access it again

### Lexikon

The Codio Lexikon is an integrated help system that lets you lookup information on a variety of languages and topics quickly and easily. Having access to concise reference information as new topics are learned is extremely useful and saves having to search the web and separate the wheat from the chaff!

You can access the Lexikon at any time from within a coding project or unit from the tools menu.

The Lexikon is organized into Topics. We currently have added 

- Crunch
- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- Linux

From the **My Classroom** screen you can view your classes, courses, projects and help by using the links on the left hand panel.

- **LEARN** links give your students access to classroom features and courses
- **BUILD** links give your students access to project tools and our professional IDE
- **HOW TO** links give your students access to our customer service team and our help documentation.

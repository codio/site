At this point the panel layout is set up automatically according to the layout specified in the first Guide section and the first section will be displayed.

Within the player various options can be controlled by the user


- **Navigation Buttons** allows the user to navigate forward/backward in the guide.

## Restore Current Files
The Restore Current Files feature is a great way for students to reset/restore any files on that page to its initial state after hacking sample code around. Students can restore their files from the menu as shown below.

Currently, it is not possible for the author to use this feature as it only works when it is used by a Student within a Class. For an author to test from the viewpoint of a student, you will need to

1. Create a Unit within a Module. If the Unit already exists, locate the Unit within a Module and enable the Edit Units slider. You should then click on Refresh Source.
1. Click on the Unit you want to test. You can then select the button 'Test Unit' which will create a copy that you can run with the same access privileges as a student would see, including the ability to restore files.

If you need support, then the most effective way is to use our integrated support system. You will find this in the dashboard and the IDE.

### Dashboard
Support is available in the dashboard from the **Contact Us** link on the left.

### IDE
Support is available within the IDE from the **Help** menu item, then **Support/Contact Us**.

### Support Dialog
There is a support dialog that appears when you invoke the support option. This tracks all conversations and threads you have had with Codio and where you can also start a new conversation.

If you are in Codio, you can see when a reply to your query arrives even if you have closed the support dialog box

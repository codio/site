If you need support, then the most effective way is to use our integrated support system. You will find this in the dashboard and the IDE.

### Dashboard
Support is available in the dashboard from the **Chat** link on the left.

### IDE
Support is available within the IDE from the **Help** menu item, then **Support**.

### Support Dialog
There is a support dialog that appears when you invoke the support option. This tracks all conversations and threads you have had with Codio and where you can also start a new conversation.

If you are in Codio, you can see when a reply to your query arrives even if you have closed the support dialog box

### Student Support
You can set a Contact URL for your students at the organisation level, see [Organisation Contact URL](/docs/dashboard/create/orgcontacturl) and/or at the class level, see [Class Contact URL](/docs/classes/classmanagement/classcontacturl) so they can raise any questions they may have directly to your preferred area

If you set the contact URL for a class, this will override any contact URL you may have set at the organisation level.

Students will then be given the option to report a problem, ask a question related to their course work or if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform, or loading a unit can contact us

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner.**

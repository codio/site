If you need support, then the most effective way is to use our integrated support system. You will find this in the dashboard and the IDE.

### Dashboard
Support is available in the dashboard from the **Contact Us** link on the left.

### IDE
Support is available within the IDE from the **Help** menu item, then **Support/Contact Us**.

### Support Dialog
There is a support dialog that appears when you invoke the support option. This tracks all conversations and threads you have had with Codio.

**** IAN : show a suitable dialog pls, IDE view I think ****

If you are in Codio, you can see if a reply to your query arrives **** IAN : how? Please show image. ****

You will also receive email notifications when a reply is made from a Codio staff member.

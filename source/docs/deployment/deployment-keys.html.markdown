When you are setting up a remote server, Codio can automatically install the Codio public key on your remote server, which saves a tedious manual process.

- You can copy a key from the Codio->Account dialog as [described here](/docs/settings-prefs/account-settings/public-key/)
- You can set up an SSH Connection and use the [Connection Manger](/docs/ssh/ssh-manager/) to do the same thing.

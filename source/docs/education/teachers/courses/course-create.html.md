SCREENSHOT

- You are required to enter a **Name** for your course. The **Description** is optional.
- The **Owner** field is important to understand. If you are a member of an organization then you may want to select the organization from the dropdown that this course belongs to. This ensures that it will appear in the Course list as belonging to that organization.
- **Visibility** determines whether your project is publicly available or should remain private to your organization. Private courses require a paid subscription. The next section explains public projects in more detail.
- **Permissions** allows you to assign course management (teacher) rights to other Codio users to this course. Start typing the user's full name or Codio user name and matches will appear automatically below. You can also assign permissions after the course has been created.

You can use Git commands within your Codio project without needing to ever set up a remote repo. This gives you not only collaborative capabilities, but also comprehensive version control.

However, one of the benefits of a distributed Source Control Management system is that having your code in more than one place means that there is no single point of failure. For this reason, we recommend that you use a third party provider such as GitHub as an external location to back up your data.

All your guides content is stored in `sections.md` in the `.guides` folder.

**Important :** the `sections.md` file should really not be edited. It is fully managed by the Guides editor and is not designed to be edited by hand (and there is no need). If you mess it up, you may have a job getting back on its feet again.

##Images
It is recommended that you place your images in the `.guides/img` folder, although you don't have to.

##Other Guides related files
The goal should generally be to keep all extra files you may use for your Guides specific operations in the `./guides` folder. This way, the rest of your workspace area will appear clean and tidy and empty of rubbish for the student.

In Play mode, the `.guides` folder and the `.codio` files are hidden from view.

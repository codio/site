Each Codio Project gets its own dedicated Ubuntu Server (Box). This chapter contains important information on accessing your box, how to administer it and how to install software dependencies.

Details of your project Box can be found by opening the `Project > Box Info` menu item, where information of your project URL(s) can be viewed.

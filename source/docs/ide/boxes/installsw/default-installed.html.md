When you create an empty Box, you get a standard Ubuntu installation. Currently, we also add the following software automatically

- Git

If you want to have more software installed by default then you should use [Stacks](/docs/project/stacks/listing/) or select one of the standard stacks from the **New Project** screen.

Please refer to the [Installing software packages](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/box-parts) section for details on how to install many other languages, database, web servers and other system components.

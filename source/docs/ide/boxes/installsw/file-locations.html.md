All Codio code workspace and software dependency files are located in the `/home/codio` folder, also reachable as `~`.

Everything below this level can be accessed and is effectively read-only. You should not change anything here as it will not persist.

Software that you install from the command line or using Install Software will be installed in the usual location for an Ubuntu server. 

## Code workspace files
The code workspace you see in the project file tree is located at `/home/codio/workspace` or `~/workspace`.

## G1 Software dependencies
For first generation projects, you can still use Box Parts and the installed software is located in the `/home/codio/.parts ` folder.

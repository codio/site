> We have now released a new generation of Codio Boxes that provide many improved capabilities. These new 'G2' Boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access. G2 boxes no longer offer Box Parts for installing software. We have replaced Box Parts with a newer and more standardized approach. 
> Our second generation projects and stacks are identified with a `G2` label. We will be gradually updating all our Certified Stacks, Packs and Units to use the G2 platform.

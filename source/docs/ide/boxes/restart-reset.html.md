Codio offers the ability to restart and to reset your project's Box. You can find both options in the **Project** menu.

## Restart
This operation reboots the Box, which usually takes a few seconds.

## Reset 
This operation is fairly destructive and should be used with caution. It resets the Box to its fresh state but leaves your code files untouched.

- any new folders or files that have been created will be deleted
- all parts of the Box outside of the `~/workspace` folder will be reset
- all code files in the `~/workspace` folder are untouched
- a Box restart

After a Reset, you will need to reinstall components (npm modules, ruby gems etc.) and other modifications you may have made.

You can set a lot of preferences in Codio. There are various ways of listing and finding preferences and their corresponding keyboard shortcuts.

- [Command Bar](/docs/ide/features/command-bar) lets you find and execute commands and actions. It only shows actionable commands, so things like Font Size, Theme are not available here. Toggle items are, however.
- `Help > Shortcuts` and type and search list that shows all keyboard shortcuts
- `Codio > Preferences > User` where a complete list is shown in the Default Preferences area and you can also modify the preferences.

To see how to modify your preferences see [Codio Preferences](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs)

Emmet also offers a very nice range of keyboard shortcuts to speed productivity even further. Keyboard actions can be modified in [Preferences](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs)

## Match Tag Pair
`Mac:Cmd+D (inward) and Shift+Cmd+D (outward)`
`WinLin:Ctrl+D (inward) and Shift+Ctrl+D (outward)`


A well-known tag balancing: searches for tag or tag's content bounds from current cursor position and selects it. It will expand (outward balancing) or shrink (inward balancing) selection when called multiple times. Not every editor supports both inward and outward balancing due of some implementation issues, most editors have outward balancing only.

## Go To Matching Pair
`Mac: Shift+Cmd+T`
`Win: Shift+Ctrl+T`


In HTML, allows you to quickly traverse between opening and closing tag.

## Wrap with Abbreviation
 `Mac/Win: Shift+Cmd+A`

A very powerful feature, it takes an abbreviation, expands it and places currently selected content in the last element of generated snippet. If there’s no selection, action will silently call “Match Tag Pair” to wrap context element.

## Go to Edit Point
`Win: Ctrl+Alt+Right Arrow or Left Arrow`

This action works for HTML code blocks and allows you to quickly traverse between important code points:

- between tags
- empty attributes
- newlines with indentation

## Select Item
`Mac/Win: Shift+Cmd+`

Action is similar to “Go to Edit Point”, but selects important code parts.

In HTML, these are tag name, full attribute and attribute value. For class attribute it also selects distinct classes.

In CSS, it matches selector, full property and property value. For complex values and functions like 1px solid red or url(image.jpg) also selects part of it.

## Toggle Comment
`Mac: Cmd+/`
`Win: Ctrl+/`


This action, as name says, toggles comments on and off for the selected line. Works nicely in CSS and HTML files.

## Remove Tag

Quickly removes tag, found by “Match Tag Pair” from current cursor position, and adjusts indentation.

## Merge Lines

Merges selected lines into a single line. But when there’s no selection, will match context HTML tag.

## Inline Calculator
`Mac: Shift+Cmd+Y`
`Win: Shift+Ctrl+Y`


Evaluates simple math expressions like 2*4 or 10/2 and outputs its result. You can use `\` operator which is equivalent to round(a/b).

Very useful in CSS where numeric values should be modified frequently.

## Increment/Decrement Number
`Mac/Win : Alt+Up/Down (inc/dec by 0.1)`

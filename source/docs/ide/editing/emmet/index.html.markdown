We have implemented lots of productivity features into the Codio IDE thanks to [Emmet](http://www.emmet.io), formerly Zen Coding. These features let you saves considerable time when working with HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

##Standard Code Editor Keyboard Shortcuts
General keyboard shortcuts can be found [in this section](/docs/ide/editing/kb-shortcuts). All other productivity shortcuts are found here in this chapter.

##Emmet Keyboard Shortcuts
A set of powerful [productivity shortcuts](/docs/ide/editing/emmet/emmet-actions) for HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

##Abbreviations
Thanks to our Emmet support, you get a large number of [HTML and CSS abbreviations](/docs/ide/editing/emmet/emmet-abbreviations/) that expand to code, a bit like this

  `div>ul>li*3`

which expands to

```
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
      </ul>
  </div>
```

Be sure to check out the [complete reference](/docs/ide/editing/emmet/emmet-ref/) as there are an awful lot of abbreviations for you to take advantage of.

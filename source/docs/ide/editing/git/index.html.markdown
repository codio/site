Git, Mercurial and SVN are all preinstalled, so you can [open up a Terminal window](/docs/ide/boxes/terminal/) to access them from the command line.

You can also configure your `.codio` file so common commands are accessible from the 'Run' menu in the Codio IDE. [Refer to the Boxes documentation](/docs/ide/boxes/runmenu/) on how to do this.

##A few Git helpers
We have added a few Git helpers to the 'Tools->Git' menu.

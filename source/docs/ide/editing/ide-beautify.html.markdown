title: Beautify Javascript

You can format your Javascript code by pressing the keyboard shortcut as defined in the [User Settings](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs). By default, it is

- `key_format_code` = `Cmd+Alt+F` (for a Mac)
- `key_format_code` = `Ctrl+Alt+F` (for anything else)

It will indent your code correctly and manage spaces and other cool things.

For example, if you start out with this

```js
if ('this_is'==/an_example/){of_beautifer();}else{var a=b?(c%d):e[f];}
```

Then after beautifying, you will end up with this

```js
if ('this_is' == /an_example/) {
    of_beautifer();
} else {
    var a = b ? (c % d) : e[f];
}
```

## Settings
If you look within the [code-beautifier] section of the Codio Preferences, you will see the various beautification settings available.

Don't forget, you can force these in [Project preferences](/docs/ide/customization/project-prefs) if you want to have consistently beautified code regardless of who edits your code.

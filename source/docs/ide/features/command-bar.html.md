The Command Bar allows you to access almost all of the Codio actions from a searchable list. It is also a great way of looking up keyboard shortcuts without having to explore the menu.

You invoke the Command Bar with

- **Tools > Command Bar**
- `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (PC/Linux)

You will then see the following popup dialog.

Now just start typing and the list will refine as you type.

Quick open (fast open) is a great way of opening files without the need to access the file tree. Invoke Quick Open from

- **File > Open File** from the menu
- `Cmd+O` (Mac) / `Ctrl+O` (PC/Linux)

... and the quick open dialog will appear.

You now start typing the name of a file and as you type, the list will narrow down. You can then select the file you want using the mouse or use the keyboard, pressing Enter on the required file.

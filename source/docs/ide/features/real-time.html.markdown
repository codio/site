If you give other Codio users permissions to access to your project, then Codio allows more than one user to view and edit files simultaneously. 

Rather like Google Docs, you will be able to see other people editing the file in real time.

Because of this collaboration feature, your files are saved in real time and there is no need to press the save button. It just happens automatically.

See also [Content collaboration](docs/content/collaboration) for more information on using Git to effectively collaborate with others.

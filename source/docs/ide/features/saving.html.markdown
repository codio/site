There is generally no need to save your files as content is saved automatically. You can still save manually using the `Ctrl+S|Cmd+S` keyboard shortcut, which most of you should be familiar with, but you don’t need to. 
If you make mistakes, then use the regular undo (`Ctrl+Z`).

Version Control is the best possible way of managing restores and this is comprehensively supported thanks to our [Git integration](/docs/ide/editing/git).

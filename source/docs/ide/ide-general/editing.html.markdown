You can open an existing file from the tree or create a new one from either the `File > New File` menu or by right-clicking in the file tree.

When you open a file, it will appear in a tab in the currently active [Panel](/docs/panels).

Codio will syntax highlight based on the file type. You can see the detected file type in the status bar. Clicking on that file type will allow you to force the syntax highlighting to another language format.

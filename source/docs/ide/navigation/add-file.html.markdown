Adding a file is done in one of two ways. First, make sure you have selected the folder within the file tree where you want the file created.

- Right-click within the file tree, taking into account your folders
- **Select File > New** from the menu

You should specify both the file name and the extension.

Right-clicking also allows you to Copy/Paste existing files.

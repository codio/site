- Right-click within the file tree, taking into account folders
- Select the **File > Upload** menu option, having first selected a folder in the file tree.

Having selected on of these options, you can upload files by

- Pressing the **browse for files** button and selecting your files
- Dragging files from your destop or file explorer into the dialog. Dragging of a folder and its contents is only supported in Chrome.

**Important:** if you select both files and folders to upload, only the files within the main folder will get uploaded. You will need to upload one folder at a time.

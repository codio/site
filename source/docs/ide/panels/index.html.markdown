IDE panels let you create any panel configuration you want for both code editing and also other features (such as [Git](/docs/ide/editing/git), [Deployment](/docs/ide/tools/deployment) etc.).

This gives you complete control over the layout of your project. Whenever you leave you project, its precise pane configuration is saved and reloaded when you come back to it.

## File Tree
The main file tree itself is a tab within a panel. If you look carefully, you will see that it can receive focus and the Filetree text is in a tab.

As a result, you can perform the exact same set of operations on it as with any other tab content. It can be moved around, removed, reinstated etc.

## Panel Focus
If you have multiple panels, the panel you click within gets the focus and can be seen by a white border.

If you want to open a file in a different panel, first click on that panel and then open a file from the file tree.

## Tabs
You can add any number of tabs into a single panel. You are also free to drag tabs around to change their order.

Tabs can also be dragged from one panel to another.

## Panel Management
Tabs can be created from the **View > Panels** menu or by using hotkeys. The next section explain the panel actions available.

Codio lets you manage panels using either hotkeys or from the **View > Panels** menu.

## Reset to Default Layout
If you want to quickly go back to a basic IDE layout, then this is easily done.

```
Mac : Cmd+Alt+R
Win : Ctrl+Alt+R
```

Menu : **View > Layouts > Default** Layout

## Split Vertical
This splits the selected panel by drawing a vertical line down the middle, so you end up with two panels side by side.

```
Mac : Cmd+Alt+V
Win : Ctrl+Alt+V
```

## Split Horizontal
This splits the selected panel by drawing a horizontal line across the middle, so you end up with one panel on top of the new panel.

```
Mac : Cmd+Alt+H
Win : Ctrl+Alt+H
```

## Close Panel
This will close the selected panel and all the tabs within it.

```
Mac : Cmd+Alt+C
Win : Ctrl+Alt+C
```

## Restore File Tree
If you deliberately or inadvertently close the file tree, you can restore it from the **View > Open/Show File Tree** menu.

## Switch Tabs
You can cycle between tabs in a panel using the keyboard. `Alt+Shift+.` takes you to the previous tab and `Alt+Shift+.` to the next. If you don't like those key bindings, open up your [preferences](/docs/ide/customization/codio-prefs) and change the `tab_switch_left` and `tab_switch_right` item.

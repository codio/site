When you are setting up a remote server, Codio can automatically install the Codio public key on your remote server, which saves a tedious manual process.

- You can copy a key from the **Codio > Account** dialog as [described here](/docs/dashboard/account/publickey)
- You can set up an SSH Connection and use the [Connection Manger](/docs/ide/tools/ssh/ssh-manager) to do the same thing.

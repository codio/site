Each time you do a deploy, a history entry is created so you have a full record of deploys and who did them.

![Deployment List](/img/docs/deploy-history.png)

If you have not selected any specific targets, then all deploys across all targets will be shown. If you select the history button for a specific target, then the history for that specific target is shown.

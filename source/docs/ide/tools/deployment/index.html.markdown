You do not to need to deploy when you are developing your project. Front-end code is automatically served up over Port 80. Access to back-end code (PHP, Ruby etc.) is done by accessing your [Box](/docs/ide/boxes/ext-access).

You can deploy from the command line (**Tools->Terminal** menu), but Codio has a great Deployment Manager that lets you deploy all or any part of your project, with a single click ,to a custom 'deployment target'. We support deployment to the following platforms.

- [FTP](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/type-ftp/)
- [SFTP](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/type-sftp/)
- [RSYNC](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/type-rsync/)
- [Nodejitsu](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/type-nj/)
- [Generic Git deployment](/docs/ide/tools/deployment/type-git/)

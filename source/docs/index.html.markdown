Welcome to the Codio documentation. We've only just released our first Public Beta, so the documentation is a little sparse right now. However, we are going to improve it fast with your help.

If you find that you still have questions that the docs do not answer, please [send us an email](mailto:ee8711023afa04b80a6b921ddb3939c1171e0f62@incoming.intercom.io) and we'll make sure we reply back as soon as possible.

Or if you fancy getting your hands dirty, this documentation and our whole site is [open sourced on Github](https://github.com/codio/site). If you see a typo, or something that doesn't look quite right; or maybe there is a section missing that you would like to write, simply [fork](https://github.com/codio/site) the repository and send us a pull request.

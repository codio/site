Please view our [Curriculum Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h7ZP3guJySx08yG_Z5JesOFVUwFtlRfEkl3ZIoTm7pk/edit?usp=sharing) for the High School Computer Science Course.

This is a course designed to expose all students to the interdisciplinary nature of computer science in todayâ€™s dynamic and globally connected society. 

Students will have the opportunity to explore the uses of computer science as a tool in creating effective solutions to complex contemporary problems. 

The hands-on nature of the course is intended to provide students with the opportunity to explore conceptual understanding in a practical learning environment. 

This course is recommended for all students as it provides an overview of computer sciences and its applications in various disciplines, professions, and personal activities.

In this course, students will learn to use computational thinking to develop algorithmic solutions to real-world problems. 

They will begin to understand the different levels of complexity in problem solving and to determine when team projects might generate more effective problem solutions than individual efforts. Students will learn and use a programming language and related tools, as well as appropriate collaboration tools, computing devices, and network environments. 

Finally, they will demonstrate an understanding of the social and ethical implications of their work and exhibit appropriate communication behavior when working as a team member. 

This course is designed for all students at the 9th and 10th grade levels.

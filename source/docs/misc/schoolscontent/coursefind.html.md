Select **Courses** from the dashboard. You will see that there are several tabs you can select.

1. **My Courses** lists only course created by you.
1. **Shared** lists courses that have been explicitly shared with you or any Organization you belong to.
1. **Recommended** lists courses that are created or recommended by Codio.
1. **All** lists courses that are Public or shared with you. This list will contain a lot of items, so you will usually want to know the name of the course you are trying to find and then use the search field. It will also search on tags (such as programming languages or topics).

If you then select a course, you are shown a list of modules. You can create new modules and add also add modules belonging to other courses to your course by selecting the **Edit Courses** slider.

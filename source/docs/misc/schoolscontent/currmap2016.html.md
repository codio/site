Please view our [Curriculum Map](https://docs.google.com/a/codio.com/spreadsheets/d/12yqcyCNh4Tt2gtXt8RR0Qt1viWytIcjdAgWUZnGEEUs/edit?usp=sharing) for the OCR GCSE (9-1) Computer Science (J276 Version 1).

Interpreting detailed specifications like the OCR J275 and J276 or a higher level specification like the GCSE Computer Science specification from the Department for Education can be a daunting task. Our curriculum maps are the best way for teachers to put the these specifications into practice and teach with confidence. You can find the curriculum maps under the description tab of the relevant courses and modules.

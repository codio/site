To create a new Organization, click on the 'Organizations' link in the left hand side of your dashboard. There are now 3 steps required

- enter the name of your Organization and choose a plan
- enter your payment details
- add any other Codio users to the Owners team

The free organization plan allows you to add any number of users to your organization but they can only create public projects. 

Paid plans allow all members to create private projects as long as they remain a member of that organization or they have their own personal Codio subscription.

##Moving from a personal Codio subscription to an Organization
If you have a team of users, each of whom has a personal Codio subscription, and you then decide to bring them into an Organizational account, then you should do the following 

- cancel the personal subscriptions; this will disable any private projects
- create your organization in Codio and add the others to the 'All Members' team; at this point, any disabled private projects will be re-enabled as active private projects

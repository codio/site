Codio's Phonegap features are in Beta until mention of it is removed from the documentation.

You access Codio's Phonegap:Build features from the Tools->Phonegap (beta) menu.

Our Phonegap support provides a comfortable integration with Adobe's Phonegap Build platform. You should first create an account at [http://build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com).

**Note:** the PhoneGap:Build free plan supports a maximum project size of 15MB and 40MB for paid plans. Account plan details can be found [here](https://build.phonegap.com/plans).

If you know the user name of another Codio user, you can enter the URL for their account which is of the format:

`https://codio.com/username`

You will then see that user's Dashboard and all public projects will be displayed. You can then load any of those projects into the IDE by clicking on it. 

You will not be able to edit the project but you can [fork](/docs/ide/features/fork) it into your own account.

If a project has been [shared](/docs/ide/customization/permissions) to you, you will be able to view this from your **My Projects > Shared with me** area.

Starter Packs are a very powerful way to create and manage templated projects that include

- The base Ubuntu operating system. This is always present so you don't need to think about this really.
- A [Stack](/docs/dashboard/stacks/) (base software dependencies such as databases, languages and other system components). This is entirely optional, but Codio's Stack features ensure that you don't have to laboriously configure the Stack.
- Any code present in your Project. It's entirely up to you what you include. It could be a Wordpress site, or a front-end framework or some working code examples.

With Starter Packs, you can organize and share your own Starter Packs as well as find Codio Certified Packs and even Packs published by others.

Once you have found the Starter Pack you want to use, you can create a new Project based on this in either of these ways

1. Click on the name of the pack  to see full details about this Pack before pressing the `Use Pack` button in the top right of the information panel.


You will then be transferred to the [Create Project](/docs/project/creating/) dialog, so Codio can create a new Project for you based on the selected Starter Pack.

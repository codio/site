> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**
>
> We are currently rolling out a new generation of Codio Boxes that will provide far greater power and control for you, as well as improved stability. These new Boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access, which means you no longer need to use the Box Parts package management system to install software. Instead, you can use the [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) package manager, which provides thousands of software packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu community.

When creating a Stack, here are some ideas on strategy and how to make them as useful as possible.

## Starting Stack
When you create a Stack, you should first create a new Project from the closest Stack that meets your requirements. You can also use the Base Stack and then [install your own components](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/box-parts/).


## Long Description
You should include a full description of your Stack that appears when someone clicks on it within the Stacks listing. This information will also be available to users in Projects by going to `Project>Stack Info` in their Project, which should open automatically. Check out some of Codio Certified Pack long descriptions.

Below is a template you could use.

```markdown
# Title
Put the name of your Stack here.

## Using the Stack
Describe how the user should get started.

## Starter Pack
If there are related Starter Packs you have created from this Stack that include code files, detail them here.

## Components Installed
It can be helpful to others or even to you later on to describe the installed Components and versions.

## Configuration Files
Detail where any component configuration files can be found. As you install components from `Tools>Install Software` a log file of all this information will be opened.

## General Information
Include any general information on the use and operation of any installed components.

## Codio Documentation
We recommend you include useful links to the Codio Documentation.

##Stack Specific Links
Provide useful links on the Stack components.
```

## Example (from the 2nd Generation Codio Certified LAMP Stack)

```markdown
# LAMP

## Using this Stack
This Codio Stack gives you a complete **LAMP** stack ready to use and with all services up and running.

## Related Stacks & Starter Packs
There are various other Stacks and Starter Packs that may be of interest. Please search the listing for

- Stack : **LEMP**
- Stack : **LAPP**
- Stack : **LAMP** + Composer

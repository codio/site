Codio projects are mounted to software configuration templates, known as Codio stacks.

You can use our pre-configured stacks or create your own. This template approach makes Codio easy to use, configure and adapt.

Codioâ€™s templates deliver fully preconfigured servers in less than 5 seconds, no matter how complex the configuration.

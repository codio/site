There are various reasons why you might want to switch your project's stack to a new one.

- **Created new stack** : this is the most important and common use case. If you have modified your stack and then created a new stack (or a new version) from it then it makes sense to point your project to it once it has been created.
- **Mistake** : you specified the wrong stack when you created the project.
- **New stack version** : a new version of a stack has been created and you want to point to the latest one.

### Important
You should remember that when you switch a stack, everything outside the workspace folder you see in the tree (`/home/codio/workspace`) will be replaced by the new stack. This is discussed at length in the [What is a stack?](/docs/project/stacks/stack-overview) section.

### From the projects listing
Select the gear icon for the project from the main projects listing. You will then be able to change the stack or the stack version.

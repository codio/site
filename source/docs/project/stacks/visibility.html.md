By default, Stacks are kept private to your account until you make them public, at which point they will appear in the **Popular** and **All** Stacks listings for all Codio Users.

If you set the owner of the Stack to your Organisation, they will appear in the **Organisations** listing for members of your Organisation

If you are a member of an Organisation, the Organisation owner can enable the ability for you to create public Stacks. See [Public/Private Settings](/docs/dashboard/create/public_private).

If you want to keep your Stack private to your Organization, select the Private option and set the Owner option to your Organization.


## Owner
By default, you will be the owner of this Stack and only you can edit it and [create new versions](/docs/project/stacks/update) of the Stack.

If you want to allow others to see and administer your Stack, you can assign it to another organization.

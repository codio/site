Here are the key things you need to know about projects.

- A project is an Ubuntu server. 
- We commonly refer to your project server as a **box**.
- You can create as many projects as you need.
- Each project box is fully isolated from every other one.
- When you open a project you are taken into the box and are shown the Codio IDE.
- You have access to the command line via a terminal window.
- You have sudo level privileges to your server, so you can install and configure any box exactly as you please.
- You can snapshot the software configuration, commonly referred to as a **stack**, of any box and add it to the **Stacks** template library.
- You can snapshot the combination of a Stack and the project code workspace and add it to the **Starter Packs** template library.

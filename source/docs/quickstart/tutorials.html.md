A [Course](/docs/dashboard/tutorials/) is a collection of Project snapshots that have been grouped and ordered. It is an ideal way of giving students access to a coherent set of Projects aimed at teaching any coding topic you like.

When combined with [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classroom/), you get a powerful way of teaching a class of students that let's you organize, review student code and grade.

Anyone creating a Course should incorporate [Codio Guides](/docs/ide/tools/guides/), a rich content authoring tool that allows students to view instructions while they edit their code.

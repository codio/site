Project preferences get the highest priority and are applied over all other settings. To modify these, you should open your project and then choose one of the following

1. From the menu, select Codio->Preferences->Project
2. From the file tree, locate the `.preferences` file

As any project preferences will be applied over your user preferences and everyone else's, you should be careful in what settings you place in here.

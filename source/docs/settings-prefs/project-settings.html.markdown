These settings are found within the IDE (a loaded project) from the `Project > Settings` menu item and also accessible from the [Dashboard](/docs/console)

Project settings, as distinct from Project preferences, are used to store the following details about the project:

- Project Name
- Project Description
- Public/Private
- Allow [Box Cloning](/docs/boxes/clone)
- Delete your Project
- Export the project as a Zip file.

title: "Joining a class as a student"

---

Your teacher can invite you to join classes that have been set up. This allows you to access the specific curriculum-mapped content and projects that have been assigned to you.


Here is how you would join a class:

1. Log in to your Codio account.

1. Go to **Join a Class** and enter the class token that your teacher has given you

1. To access your class in future, go to the [My Classroom](/docs/student/myclassroom) area

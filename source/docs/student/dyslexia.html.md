### Dyslexia support

Codio has a built in dyslexia support feature. If you have students who would prefer to view their screen in dyslexia support mode they should do the following:

1. Open the unit they are working on.

1. From the menu at the top right of the screen, choose ‘Settings’, then ‘Theme’, then ‘Dyslexic’
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/xxxxxx.png" class="simple"/>

1. The screen should now display like this:
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/xxxxxx.png" class="simple"/>

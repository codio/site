### My Classroom

The ‘My Classroom’ area is where you can see the modules and units that have been assigned to you. Pinned units will be displayed more prominently at the top of the page.

Below is an example of a student’s ‘My Classroom’ area:

Using the ‘My Classroom’ area, you can easily re-open the unit you were last working on, or start/open any of the other units that have been assigned to you. You  start or open units using the navigation buttons displayed.

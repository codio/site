If you are not part of a schools, university, colleges or other such organisation then you do not need to read this section.

In most cases, your teacher will have added you to a Codio Class or has sent you a unique two word password to join a class. Go to 'Join a Class' in the left hand menu to enter this password and join the class. You can be a member of multiple classes.

## My Classroom

The most recently accessed units will be shown to you at the top of the screen and you can simply click to open them and carry on where you left off.

The My Classroom dashboard is also where you can access and select any other class(es), course(s) and module(s) you wish to work with from the available drop downs.

## Unit Listing
When you have selected your Module, then all the Units in that module will be displayed along with your progress that includes the number of Assessments in the Unit, the number you have answered, the number you have got correct and the Points (%). In most cases each Assessment is assigned 1 point but this may not always be the case.

When you click on the Ready to Go button (circled) the Unit will be forked into your account and started. This may take a few seconds. 

## My Projects Listing
Any projects you have created yourself will appear in this listing.

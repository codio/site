### Forgotten passwords / changing passwords

If you have forgotten your password, you should use the ‘lost password’ link on the log-in page to reset their password automatically via email. If you do not have access to the email address you used in creating your Codio account, contact your teachers who can reset the password for you.

If you wish to change your password (you should also do this if you forgot your password and it was reset) follow these steps:

1. Click on their name and gravatar (bottom left of screen)

1. About halfway down the ‘Account’ page is the ‘Change Password’ area. The student should enter their new password, and then click ‘Update password’.

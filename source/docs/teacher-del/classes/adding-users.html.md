## Owners
The only users who can create classes are organization owners. 

Owners are the only users who are able to delete classes.

## Adding users to your Organisation

Codio provides a number of ways to add users into your organisation.
See [Adding users to your Organisation](/docs/dashboard/organizations/adding-members/) for more information on this.

## Adding teachers
If you are the creator of the class, you are automatically added as a teacher to that class. You can also add others as teachers to the class. 

Teachers are able to view student projects from the student listing within the class. They can also assign modules.

1. Go to your class.
1. Click on the **Admin** tab at the top of the listing.
1. Click the **Edit** button to enable the **Add Teacher** dialog, click this and the 'Add a Teacher' dialog will pop up.
1. This list will show all Codio users within your organization if you enable the 'Filter by organisation' option, but if that person is not already a member of your organisation but is a Codio user, deselect this option to search for their Codio username. Do though be sure to select the right person. You can type in the field to search or you can scroll through the list. Once you have found the right person, click on that person or press enter with the correct name highlighted.

The teacher is now added to the list of teachers.

## Adding Students
To add students, who are Codio users already, you can send them the 'Class Token' that they can then enter in the 'Join a Class' area in their dashboard and they will then be added automatically into this class.  You can also add them by going to the **Student** tab to add existing users in the same way as adding Teachers above.

**Please Note**: You can regenerate the class token at any time but any users who were previously sent the original token will not be able to use that old token

Also see [Bulk Student Upload](/docs/teacher/classes/bulk-upload/) where you can send new users an email that will take them through the sign up process to become Codio members and also automatically add them into your Organisation and the Class.

There are 2 main reasons why you should create a class.

1. You can see teacher solutions associated with challenges that are embedded within the content .
1. You can add students to a class and then assign them Modules and Units.

## Steps required
To create a class

1. From you Codio dashboard, click on the **My Classroom** link on the left hand side.
1. Click the **+** button in the top right.
1. Complete all required fields. Be sure to choose a sensible class name that will be properly recognized by your students.

## Class listing
Users can see the class listing when they select the **My Classroom** link on the left.

Classes you have just created will only be visible to owners and teachers assigned to that class. You can later add students to the class so they too, see the class listing.

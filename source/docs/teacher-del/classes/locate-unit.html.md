1. Select the 3 vertical dots to the right of the units and you will see the options to 'Open as Teacher'
1. Press it to open the unit and play with the content.
1. If you click on the number in the 'Students started' column, you can then see all students who have started that unit (if any have actually started it). You can also open the unit from this screen by pressing the **>** button in the top right.

Once the unit is open, you can use the content. If you move to a challenge page, then you will see teacher solutions.

Students can find modules and units in one of two ways.

## Classes
The best and easiest way for students to access their unit content is via the **My Classroom** option in the main Codio dashboard. 

Students should

1. Click on the dropdowns to select the class/course and module.
1. Press the **Ready to Go** button for the Unit they want to take.

At this point the unit will open up and they can start working.

**Important**: 

1. If your students are not seeing the courses/modules you have added to your class and these are Private courses/modules, check that you have set your Organisation as the owner of the course/module when you published the course. See the section on Visibilty [here](/docs/tuts/publish/course-create/) for more on this.
1. Any units you may have disabled will not be accessible by your students, even if they have already started them in the past. This can be useful if you are running a Controlled Assessment in your classes or if you are authoring your own content and wish to check it out within the class yourself first. 


## Courses
Students can also browse the **Courses** from the main Codio dashboard. They can browse modules and units and start a unit from there also even if they have not been added to a class or assigned a module from a class by a teacher.

The advantage of this is that students are free to use any content available on the Codio platform.

If a teacher later creates a class, adds students and assigns a module then Codio will look to see if the students added have already started a unit directly from courses and associate those with the class automatically.

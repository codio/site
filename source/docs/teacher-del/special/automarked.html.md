Whether you are using Codio's extensive teaching content or creating your own, automatically graded assessments are a real highlight.

They solve the dual problem of 

- providing students with assessments at the right time
- ensuring that the minimum of teaching time is taking up grading

The results of these assessments are then automatically shown in the teacher's class dashboard along with the number of students that have started each Unit of content.

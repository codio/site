The teacher class dashboard allows a teacher to monitor the following 

- which students are in the class
- how much time each student is spending on each Course, Module and Unit
- what results each student is achieving for assessments across a Course, Module and Unit
= what assessments a student got wrong in any unit

As soon as a student completes an assessment, the result is fed through immediately as is time spent.

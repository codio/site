Auto-graded assessments allow you to view your students’ progress throughout the modules and units that have been assigned to them. Codio’s [curriculum-mapped content](/docs/account/content/courses/recommended) contains [auto-graded assessments](/docs/account/content/authoring/create/assessments). All you need to do is assign curriculum-mapped content to your class and then [view your students’ progress](/docs/teacher/assess/progress).

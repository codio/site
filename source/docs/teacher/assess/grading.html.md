Once students have completed their assignments, they should notify the teacher of completion by going to the 'Education->Mark as completed' menu item. 

The teacher can select a class and drill down to a module/unit to see all students who have been assigned that module or by going to the Students tab can then find the student and access all the units they have completed. Students that have completed the module will have a check mark showing.

At this point, the teacher will probably [review the code](/docs/teacher/assess/student-code) and then assign comments and ultimately a grade.

To assign comments or a grade, you click on the Grade icon. You can then modify the comments and grade fields for any individual student.

When ready the teacher can 'Release grades' so that the students will be able to see their grades from either their My Classroom view or by opening the unit and going to 'Education->See Grades.

Grades can be released by the teacher either from the Unit detailed view (see top image above) or from the main Unit view right clicking on the 3 vertical dots and selecting 'Release grades'.

In real life, your class may be taught by more than one teacher. If this is the case, you can add another teacher to your Codio class in the following way:

1. First, make sure the teacher you want to add to your class is a member of your organization. Jump to [Add Teachers](/docs/teacher/create/addteachers), and look at step 7  to learn how to do this.

1. From the **My Classroom** area, click on your class to open it.

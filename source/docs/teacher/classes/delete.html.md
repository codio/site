A class can be deleted by the class owner and those with administration permissions granted by the owner.

- Select the class, go to the `Admin` area and then press the 'Delete Class' button.

- You can delete just the class or you can also delete the class AND remove the students from your organisation as well. Be aware that if you select the option to **Delete the Class and Students** and any of the students in this class are also members in other classes, they will also be removed from those classes as well. If you are unsure if any students are members in other classes, we would recommend you select the option to **Delete Class Only**.

- Teachers with the [Administrator Role](/docs/teacher/create/adminrole/) are able to view a list of any members that are no longer members of any classes and remove any users from the organisation accordingly. See [View Organisation Members](/docs/teacher/create/viewmembers/) for more information

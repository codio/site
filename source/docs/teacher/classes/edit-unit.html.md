The Edit Unit action from the blue dot menu allows you to change the settings of the Unit

- Unit name
- Description
- Image assigned to the Unit
- Stack (and Stack Version)
- Source project from which the unit is taken

From this screen you can also 'Refresh Source' to update the saved snapshot. You can also elect to then push the update out to any students that may have already started the unit so they do not need to start it again from the beginning.

### Pinning a Unit

You can pin a unit for your class. This unit will appear ‘pinned’ to the top of the student dashboard when students log-in in order to draw their attention to it. (Jump to [student dashboard](/docs/student/myclassroom) to find out more about what students see)

To pin a unit:
1. From the 'My Classroom' area, click on your class to open it.

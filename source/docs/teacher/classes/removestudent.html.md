If a student leaves or move classes in real life you may want to remove them from your Codio class. To do this follow the steps below:

1. From the **My Classroom** area, click on your class to open it.

1. You will see all students in your class displayed on this screen. Find the student that you want to remove from the class and click on the blue triple dot icon to the right of their name. Choose **Remove student** to take them out of the class. (Note: this does not remove your student entirely from your organization - if you wish to do this, see [Remove Members](/docs/teacher/create/removemembers))

### Add organization owners
You are the ‘owner of your organization if you created it. You can add other owners (these will usually be other teachers who you wish to give admin rights to).
To add other ‘owners’ and give them admin rights:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>
1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under ‘My Organizations’, which is about halfway down the screen. 
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organisation/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>
1. Click the ‘Members’ tab
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organisation/memberstab.png" class="simple"/>
1. Click ‘Owners’
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organisation/owners.png" class="simple"/>
You should see yourself listed as an owner. To add another teacher, choose the ‘Add User’ drop down and select them from the list (note - the teacher must already have been added to your organization to appear in this list - see [Add Teachers](/docs/teacher/create/addteachers) for help.

Once you have set up your organization, the next step is to invite teachers to use Codio too. This is a very easy process, follow the steps below:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the **Organization Settings** tab
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/deleteorg/orgsettingstab.png" class="simple"/>

1. About half way down you will see an **Invitation** area, displaying an **Invite URL** and an **Invite token**. 
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/invitation.png" class="simple"/>

1. Give any teachers who are not already Codio users the invite URL.

1. When they enter the URL in their browser, they will automatically be taken through the sign-up process and as they select that they are a Teacher, will then be added to your Organization.

1. Alternatively, teachers can register themselves for a Codio account by following the sign-up process at www.codio.com. Once they have done this (selecting that they are a **Teacher**, they will be asked for an **Invite token** to join your educational organization. This is provided in step 4 above - give them the token (not the URL).

1. If you already have Classes set up you can add Teachers who are existing Codio user as a **Teacher** to any specific classes. See [Adding Teachers to a class](/docs/teacher/classes/addteachers/)

You can then if you wish add them as an [Organisation Owner](/docs/teacher/create/addowners/) so they can then manage and create Classes themselves.

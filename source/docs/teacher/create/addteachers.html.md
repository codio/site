### Add teachers 
Once you have set up your organization, the next step is to invite teachers to use Codio too. This is a very easy process, follow the steps below:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

1. Click the name of your organization (under ‘My Organizations’)
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the ‘Organization Settings’ tab
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/deleteorg/orgsettingstab.png" class="simple"/>

1. About half way down you will see an ‘invitation’ area, displaying an ‘invite URL’ and an ‘invite token’.

1. Give any teachers you want to join your organisation the invite URL.

1. When they enter the URL in their browser, they will automatically be taken through the sign-up process.

1. Alternatively, teachers can register themselves for a Codio account by following the sign-up process at www.codio.com. Once they have done this, they will be asked for an ‘invitation token’ to join your educational organization. This is provided in step 4 above - give them the token (not the URL) and they will automatically become owners of your organization.

As the creator of your educational ‘organization’ in Codio, you have administrator rights. This means that you can add and remove [teachers](/docs/teacher/create/addteachers/) and [students](/docs/teacher/create/bulkupload/) from your organization, edit your organization information, manage your students [dashboard settings](/docs/teacher/create/dash/), create [grading templates](/docs/teacher/assess/rubric/) and [delete](/docs/teacher/create/deleteorg/) your organization.

To access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of  **Classes**)

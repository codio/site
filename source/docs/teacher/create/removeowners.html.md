### Remove owners
You may want to remove one or more of the Admin owners you have set for your organization. It is worth noting that you always need at least one admin owner. (If you want to know how to add admin owners, jump to [Add organization owners](docs/teacher/create/addteachers)).

To remove admin owners:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under ‘My Organizations’, which is about halfway down the screen.

1. Choose ‘Remove’ on the right hand side of the name of the person whose admin rights you want to remove. (note: you must always have at least one person in this group to act as the administrator)

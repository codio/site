Sometimes you might need to check who is registered as a member of your educational organization. To view all members of your school ‘organization’ follow these steps:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen. 
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the **Members** tab 
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/memberstab.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click **All Members**
<img alt="authtoken" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/members.png" class="simple"/>

You will be able to see all the members of your school ‘organization’.

The 'Test Students' group contains the demo student accounts created for you when the Organisation was created. See [Create Organisation](/docs/teacher/create/) for more information.

Please note that you will only see your users in the Teachers group when they are added to Class(es) as a Teacher, and in the Students group when they are added to Class(es) as a Student.

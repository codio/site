### View organization members
Sometimes you might need to check who is registered as a member of your educational organization. To view all members of your school ‘organization’:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under ‘My Organizations’, which is about halfway down the screen.

## Classes
In order to use this feature you need to set up a class. If you are not using Codio as your main IDE and want to use only the plagiarism detection feature then you should still follow these instructions and ask your students to upload their code into the project using Git or by uploading files manually.

## Run
You can see the 'Plagiarism' button near in the upper part of the screen. When you press this you are taken to the following screen.

This screen will show you any plagiarism reports that were run in the past. You can open these if you wish.

On the left you can restrict the file types that should be checked. This useful to avoid generating unnecessary noise in your report. It is possible to add multiple file types by pressing the 'Add Extension' button.

Once you are ready to run a new report, press the 'Start' button, which will package up all the files and pass them to the detection engine. You are free to leave the screen at this point and return to it later to see whether the report has been generated.

Codio will include all code from all students in the report, irrespective of whether the assignment is marked by the student as completed.

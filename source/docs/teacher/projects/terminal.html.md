All Codio projects come with their own dedicated servers. You can control this form the Linux command line as with any developer environment.

## The Terminal
You manage your server by opening a Terminal window from the Terminal option in the Tools menu. 

## Learning about the Linux command line
Codio has a course explaining how to use the Linux command line.

From your Codio dashboard, look for **Courses** in the left menu. If not already selected, select the **Recommended** tab in the top tab bar.

You will find a course 'Linux Command Line Interface'. This has tutorial content with integrated challenge assessments.

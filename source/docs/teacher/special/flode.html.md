Flode is a flowcharting tool with a major difference. Here are the headline features

- create beautiful, annotated flow charts
- write proper code expressions, including decisions, in chart elements
- integrated debugger
- export your charts as images for project write-ups
- input and output elements so automated tests can auto-grade charts.

Flode is a great way if teaching kids computational thinking and introducing them to programming. Please see the sections below for details on how to access ready made course or how to create your own projects where students can create Flode charts within their own projects.

## Flode teaching content
Codio offers some excellent teaching content using Flode. The content also contains many auto-marked challenge assessments, the results of which feed straight through to the teacher dashboard. To access this content ...

1. Log into Codio
1. Select Courses from the items on the left of the Dashboard
1. Look for 'An Introduction to Programming'

'An Introduction to Prgramming' uses Flode extensively and provides an excellent way of introducing students to programming, computational thinking and Algorithms.

## Creating and editing a new Flode file
If you want to create Flode charts independently of any Codio Course content, create a new project from the Dashboard. 

Once inside a project, to create a new flow chart, simply create a new file with the extension `.flode`. A new Flode window will appear and you can start creating and editing your chart.

A new file is created from either the File menu or by right-clicking on the project name line in the file tree.

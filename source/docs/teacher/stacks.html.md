![Stacks List](/img/docs/stacks_list.png)

Codio [Stacks](/docs/quickstart/stacks/) offers you a range of Certified Stacks that contain commonly used, pre-configured software dependencies (languages, databases and other components).

Additionally, you can create your own Stacks within a Project using the [Install software](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/) option. Once you have configured everything, you can create your own Stack from this project and it will appear in your private Stacks listing. You can even publish Stacks for others to see.

##Creating a Project from a Stack
To create a Project from your Stacks listing, simply select it and you'll be shown the Stack information screen.

From here, you can click the 'Use Stack' button and you'll be taken to the Create Project screen.

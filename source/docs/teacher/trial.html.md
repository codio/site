During your trial period, there are several things we recommend evaluating. If at any time you feel you would benefit from a personal explanation of the platform, we strongly recommend attending a live webinar. Information on our webinars can be found [here](/docs/teacher/webinars/).

The documentation in this section contains many videos. We recommend you watch these to get a first impression and high level overview of the features and content available.

## Basics
- If you have not already done so, [create an organization account](/docs/teacher/classes/create-org/). This is the best basis for trialing Codio as it gives you access to all features. 
- [Explore Codio's courses](/docs/teacher/courses/).
- Explore the many [special teaching features](/docs/teacher/special/) you will find in Codio.

## Class Management
Codio offers important class administration support for teachers. Here are a few things worth exploring.

- [Setting up classes and assigning course content to them](/docs/teacher/classes/).
- [Teacher dashboards](/docs/teacher/classes/dashboard/) for monitoring student time spent and assessment progress.
- [Bulk uploading](/docs/teacher/classes/bulk-upload/) of class/student data from your school MIS systems.
- See how [solutions that only teachers are able to see](/docs/teacher/special/tsolutions/) is embedded in course content.

## Project Work
Aside from the courses, Codio also offers an amazing coding platform that lets students code 100% in the Cloud. They have access to dedicated *Computers in the Cloud* that let them create projects and applications in any programming language using databases, the Linux command line and much more.

- Please refer to [this section](/docs/teacher/projects/) for full details.

The Codio Lexikon is an integrated help system that lets users lookup information on a variety of languages and topics quickly and easily. Having access to concise reference information as new topics are learned is extremely useful and saves having to search the web and separate the wheat from the chaff!

The Lexikon is organized into Topics. We currently have added Javascript and Crunch. However, we can easily add coverage for any other Topic. If you are interested in additional topics, please email support@codio.com.

## Using the Lexikon with Guides
To make accessing the Lexikon from your Guides content even easier, we have a [Global Option in the Guides settings](/docs/tuts/author/lexikon) that lets you specify the default topic to select. If you use this option, an icon will appear in the Guide toolbar that will load the Lexikon window with the selected topic automatically selected.

Codio support both single and multiple response versions of MCQs.

## Assessment definition
Setting up a Code Test within the Guide editor is very simple. As you can see from the screenshot below, you should specify the following details

- **Name** is a short name that describes the assessment. This name will appear in teacher dashboards, so naming it clearly is important so teachers can see precisely which challenges are successfully met (or not) by students. In many cases, you do not want to see this text appear within the challenge text the student sees. To supress this text, flip the switch next to the name field.
- The **Multiple Response** slider indicates whether the user can select more than one answer, in which case check boxes are used instead of radio buttons.
- **Question** is the question text that is shown to the student above the answers.
- **Correct Points** is the score given to the student if the student makes the correct selection(s). You can choose any positive numeric value.
- **Incorrect Points** is the score given to the student if the student makes an incorrect selection. Typically, this value will be 0 but you can assign negative scores if you wish to penalize guessing.
- **Answers** is where you add as many individual answers as you require. To indicate the correct answer(s), adjust the sliders for multiple response or the radio button for single response.

## Once chance only!!
Codio allows users to make their selections and move on to other content pages or assessments without actually submitting their answer. However, once the amswer has been submitted, it cannot be resubmitted. We believe that this gives teachers a far clearer understanding of which students are understanding the materials properly. There is little point to tests if the student simple changes the answers until the correct one appears.

However, once the answer has been submitted, the student is told whether they have the right answer or not. If not, then they are shown the correct answer. We will soon introduce an additional feature that allows the author to not show answers at all, which makes it more suitable for more formal tests where students don't know until later how they did and which were the correct answers.

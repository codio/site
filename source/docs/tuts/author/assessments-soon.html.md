In September 2015, we will be adding the following new assessment types. All of these will require manual marking by the teacher. The teacher dashboard will make it clear to the teacher when students have submitted these asseassment types and provide the interface for grading of questions as well as grading schemes. Comments can also be made by the teacher to the student.

- **Free Text** asks a question which the student is expected to answer with writtne text. This can be a few words or a full blown essay.
- **Project Assessment** should be used where a student is expected to write some code that should be manually assessed by a teacher. The dashboard will allow the teacher to instantly access the student's project for proper review before a grade is given. 

We will also be releasing a special feature that supports 'Controlled Assessments'. This allows a teacher to control exactly when a student is able to work on a project and when not. A teacher can manually enable or disable access at any point, for instance to ensure that Controlled Assessments are only carried out during supervised class times.

Codio Guides has support for Dyslexic users where they can change the [Play Mode](/docs/ide/tools/guides/play/) theme to use a special Dyslexic font. Thanks to [http://opendyslexic.org/](http://opendyslexic.org/)

This will change to a font that increases readability for readers with dyslexia and also show a bar highlighting the text the user can move with their mouse.

A Codio project can have a single Guide. Within that Guide you can have as many sections as you like.

To create a new Guide, or to edit an existing one, go to the 'Tools->Edit Guide' menu option.

Having selected 'Edit Guides' you will see your Guides window appear.

Use the Layout modes to switch between editor, preview,code and split view modes.

## Anatomy of the Guides Editor

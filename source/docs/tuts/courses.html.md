Codio offers a 3 level hierarchy for organising and publishing course materials. 

- A [Course](/docs/dashboard/courses/) is the top level and consists of a collection of Modules.
- A [Module](/docs/dashboard/modules/) will typically incorporate all the course materials to cover a logical area of a curriculum or coursework. It in turn consists of a collection of Units.
- A [Unit](/docs/dashboard/modules/module-add) is the lowest level item of coursework. It will typically contain enough material to cover a particular topic or area of a curriculum or coursework.

Take a look at the '[Schools Computing Curriculum](https://codio.com/home/courses/557540466201adf25c93ccec/?tab=modules)' Course and you can see its associated Modules and, within each Module, the Units.

## Authoring your own content
All materials you find in the Recommended Courses section have been created using the Codio Guides editor. You have access to these tools so you can create your own teaching materials and assessments.

Please refer to the [Guides Authoring](/docs/tuts/author) section for details.

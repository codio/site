Codio offers a 3 level hierarchy for organising and publishing course materials developed using the Codio Guides editor. 

- A Course is the top level and consists of a collection of Modules.
- A Module will typically incorporate all the course materials to cover a logical area of a curriculum or coursework. It in turn consists of a collection of Units.
- A Unit is the lowest level item of coursework. It will typically contain enough material to cover a particular topic or area of a curriculum or coursework.

Take a look at the 'Schools Computing Curriculum' Course and you can see its associated Modules and, within each Module, the Units.

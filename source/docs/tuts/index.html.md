Creating tutorials in Codio offers a completely different experience to regular web based tutorials, whether text based or video.

- You can present both instructions and real, working code
- The user can modify the code and run it, so learn by doing
- Present different pieces of code for different tutorial sections
- Allow the user to revert back to the initial state for a chapter if they have damaged the code beyond repair while experimenting
- Integrate many different assessment types directly into the Guide
- If used in a multi-student teaching environment, teachers can monitor progress based on assessment results and time spent
- The Course, Module, Unit hierarchy caters for the largest imaginable Courses

The main aim of a Codio tutorial is to provide a totally new type of teaching and learning experience and one that elegantly combines theory and practice.

Read on to find out how to author your own teaching content and how to make best use of the Codio Guides authoring tools.

      Courses mapped to leading National Curricula

    <p>
      Access to our 80+ course units comes as a standard with any Codio licence. We are constantly
      working with the UK's national exam board, <a href="/docs/teacher/courses/ocr/">Oxford, Cambridge and RSA</a> (OCR)
      to ensure our content is mapped to national curriculum standards. For further details, please
      see our curriculum map for the <a href="https://codio.com/docs/content/courses/currmap2016/">GSCE
      J276 specification</a>. We are now in the process of mapping
      our curriculum to the  K12cs.org framework for USA K-12 schools.

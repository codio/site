      content and assessments to any of your classes. You can also

            You don't need to wait on students submitting work before you can see how they are progressing. Codio lets you instantly view, compile and execute student code at any

            Save time because you don’t need

            Results appear in the teacher dashboard

            Gives you the big picture. Our teacher dashboard lets you see when students have accessed or completed assignments, and
            how they've performed. The student dashboard lets your students see what they have to
            do next, and what grades they’ve achieved.

          I particularly like the fact that it's a complete package. There's no software to install on the school's computers, students can freely access work at home and can 'hack-around' their code without posing a risk to the school's system. Overall I would thoroughly recommend Codio.

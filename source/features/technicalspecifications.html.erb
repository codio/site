        dealing with very large numbers of users already and more and more every day.</p>
      <h3>Always On Boxes</h3>
      <p>Codio servers automatically shut down when they are not in use and start on demand in a
        couple of seconds. If you don't want your server to shut down when not in use, you can use
        our optional Always On Box allocation.</p>

      <h2>Grading & Auto-Grading</h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Standard auto graded code tests</h3>
      <p>Dialog driven, this approach is lets you create tests based on argument and stdin inputs
        and match expected output. You can create several tests cases for each assessment to ensure
        full code coverage. Caters for at least 80% of cases.</p>
      <h3>Advanced auto graded code tests</h3>
      <p>This gives you complete control over how your tests execute. Use any language you like to
        script the tests and use any framework or library such as JUnit to help.</p>
      <h3>Multiple choice questions</h3>
      <p>Single and multiple response MCQs. Supports negative points for incorrect answers.</p>
      <h3>Fill in the blank</h3>
      <p>An autograded assessment type that requires students to complete words or phrases in a
        sentence by entering text or selecting from a dropdown list.</p>
      <h3>Free text answer</h3>
      <p>A manually graded assessment type that requires a student to enter a free text answer to a
        question. Grading is done from the teacher dashboard.</p>
      <h3>Manual grading</h3>
      <p>Allows a teacher to review a project assignment and assign a manual grade. See below for
        additional related features.</p>
      <h3>Grading rubric</h3>
      <p>A user definable two dimensional matrix with grading criteria on the side and scores across
        the top. Weighting can be applied to both axes. This can then be displayed during the manual
        grading process as a reference or can be clicked in to automatically calculate the grade.</p>
      <h3>Grading moderation</h3>
      <p>Secondary faculty members can review the grading and assign a parallel grade. These can then be reviewed to ensure grading consistency.</p>
      <h3>Grade -> LMS gradebook transfer</h3>
      <p>If a class is LMS enabled, grades (auto graded and manual) can be transferred back to the
        LMS gradebook for the matching unit.</p>
      <h3>Releasing grades</h3>
      <p>By default, grades are not shown to students or passed to an LMS platform (if used).
        Releasing grades ensures that all grades are shown when the teacher decides.</p>
      <h3>End of coding assignment auto grading</h3>
      <p>Run an auto grading script when the student has completed the assignment unit. Can also be
        triggered manually by the teacher to process an entire class.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="lms" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>LMS</h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Class management</h3>
      <p>Create classes of students and assign content and projects.</p>
      <h3>LMS integration</h3>
      <p>Although Codio is a superb LMS for coding in its own right, we appreciate the need to
        integrate with LMS platforms. Our LTI integration gives your LMS full control and covers
        account creation, single sign on, LMS unit mapping and grade passthrough.</p>
      <h3>Adding students</h3>
      <p>You can add students to your class using either an invitation URL or using your LMS. No need
      to deal with complex exports and imports.</p>
      <h3>Adding content</h3>
      <p>You can assign any server, project or piece of tutorial content to your class with just a
        couple of clicks. Each student will instantly have their own cloned copy to work with exactly
        as you configured it.</p>
      <h3>Teaching assistants</h3>
      <p>You can add any number of teaching assistants to a class so they can help reviewing student
        code, grading and other tasks.</p>
      <h3>Class dashboard</h3>
      <p>Our dashboard allows you to monitor all aspects of student progress. You can see time spent,
        unit scores and scores for individual assessments.</p>
      <h3>CSV export</h3>
      <p>You are able to export all class data to a CSV file.</p>
      <h3>Instant access to student code</h3>
      <p>This is one of Codio’s most beloved features. With a single click, you can instantly access
        any student’s code. You have full access to the project, so you can review, compile, run and
        grade the students work. It spells an end to emailing or painful aggregation of student code.</p>
      <h3>Plagiarism detection</h3>
      <p>A plagiarism detection capability that was specially developed at Princeton University to
        ensure the best possible results for student programming assignments. Detection is launched
        across all students with a single click. No need to painstakingly aggregate code upload it
        for processing.</p>
      <h3>Pin unit</h3>
      <p>Allows you to pin a unit of teaching content to the top of the student dashboard for easy location.</p>
      <h3>Controlled assessments</h3>
      <p>Specify a start and end date and time for a teaching unit. The unit will not be accessible
        outside these times. Auto grading scripts can be automatically triggered upon completion.</p>
      <h3>Grading rubric mapping</h3>
      <p>Map a grading rubric to a teaching unit to support manual grading.</p>
      <h3>Gigabox assignment</h3>
      <p>Specify that a Gigabox (larger memory allocation) should be used for a given unit.</p>
      <h3>Release grades</h3>
      <p>Allows a teacher to release grades to the students and to an LMS platform, if one is being used.</p>

    <div id="curriculum" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>Curriculum Authoring</h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Codio Guides</h3>
      <p>A content and curriculum authoring tool that controls the IDE as a student navigates through
        the content.</p>
      <h3>Assessment creation</h3>
      <p>All assessment types are authored in Guides. See above section for a complete list of assessment types.</p>
      <h3>Curriculum course management</h3>
      <p>A course is comprised of teaching assignment units that are organized into a simple hierarchy.
        Course materials can be assigned to a class.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="templating" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>Templating</h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Stacks</h3>
      <p>A template library that allows a snapshot to be taken of an underlying server configuration
        for any project. The snapshot can then be applied to new projects or replace the stack on an
        existing one.</p>
      <h3>Starter Packs</h3>
      <p>A combination of a Stack (see above) and code. Most often used as a way of providing
        students instant access to a working project as a suitable starting point for the remainder
        of a coding exercise.</p>

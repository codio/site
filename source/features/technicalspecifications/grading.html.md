###Standard auto graded code tests
Dialog driven, this approach is lets you create tests based on argument and stdin inputs and match expected output. You can create several tests cases for each assessment to ensure full code coverage. Caters for at least 80% of cases.

###Advanced auto graded code tests
This gives you complete control over how your tests execute. Use any language you like to script the tests and use any framework or library such as JUnit to help.

###Multiple choice questions
Single and multiple response MCQs. Supports negative points for incorrect answers.

###Fill in the blank
An autograded assessment type that requires students to complete words or phrases in a sentence by entering text or selecting from a dropdown list.

###Free text answer
A manually graded assessment type that requires a student to enter a free text answer to a question. Grading is done from the teacher dashboard.

###Manual grading
Allows a teacher to review a project assignment and assign a manual grade. See below for additional related features.

###Grading rubric
A user definable two dimensional matrix with grading criteria on the side and scores across the top. Weighting can be applied to both axes. This can then be displayed during the manual grading process as a reference or can be clicked in to automatically calculate the grade.

###Grading moderation
Secondary faculty members can review the grading and assign a parallel grade. These can then be reviewed to ensure grading consistency.

###Grade -> LMS gradebook transfer
If a class is LMS enabled, grades (auto graded and manual) can be transferred back to the LMS gradebook for the matching unit.

###Releasing grades
By default, grades are not shown to students or passed to an LMS platform (if used). Releasing grades ensures that all grades are shown when the teacher decides.

###End of coding assignment auto grading
Run an auto grading script when the student has completed the assignment unit. Can also be triggered manually by the teacher to process an entire class.

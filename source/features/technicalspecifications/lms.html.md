###Class management
Create classes of students and assign content and projects.

###LMS integration
Although Codio is a superb LMS for coding in its own right, we appreciate the need to integrate with LMS platforms. Our LTI integration gives your LMS full control and covers account creation, single sign on, LMS unit mapping and grade passthrough.

###Adding students
You can add students to your class using either an invitation URL or using your LMS. No need to deal with complex exports and imports.

###Adding content
You can assign any server, project or piece of tutorial content to your class with just a couple of clicks. Each student will instantly have their own cloned copy to work with exactly as you configured it.

###Teaching assistants
You can add any number of teaching assistants to a class so they can help reviewing student code, grading and other tasks.

###Class dashboard
Our dashboard allows you to monitor all aspects of student progress. You can see time spent, unit scores and scores for individual assessments.

###CSV export
You are able to export all class data to a CSV file.

###Instant access to student code
This is one of Codio’s most beloved features. With a single click, you can instantly access any student’s code. You have full access to the project, so you can review, compile, run and grade the students work. It spells an end to emailing or painful aggregation of student code.

###Plagiarism detection
A plagiarism detection capability that was specially developed at Princeton University to ensure the best possible results for student programming assignments. Detection is launched across all students with a single click. No need to painstakingly aggregate code upload it for processing.

###Pin unit
Allows you to pin a unit of teaching content to the top of the student dashboard for easy location.

###Controlled assessments
Specify a start and end date and time for a teaching unit. The unit will not be accessible outside these times. Auto grading scripts can be automatically triggered upon completion.

###Grading rubric mapping
Map a grading rubric to a teaching unit to support manual grading.

###Gigabox assignment
Specify that a Gigabox (larger memory allocation) should be used for a given unit.

###Release grades
Allows a teacher to release grades to the students and to an LMS platform, if one is being used.

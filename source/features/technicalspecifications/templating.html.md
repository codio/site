###Stacks
A template library that allows a snapshot to be taken of an underlying server configuration for any project. The snapshot can then be applied to new projects or replace the stack on an existing one.

###Starter Packs
A combination of a Stack (see above) and code. Most often used as a way of providing students instant access to a working project as a suitable starting point for the remainder of a coding exercise.

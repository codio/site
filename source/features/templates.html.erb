      Codio works with a series of templates, or Codio
      stacks. You can use our pre-configured stacks or
      create your own. This template approach makes
      Codio easy to use, configure and adapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Codio's templates deliver fully preconfigured servers in less than 5 seconds, no matter how complex the configuration.

          Stacks are simply Codio boxes that have the base software
          components installed and are fully configured. You simply take a
          snapshot of the box contents to save it as a stack. With one click,
          it's ready for your students to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Codio comes with a number of stacks pre-loaded. You can create
          your own stacks, from scratch or by adapting an existing stack, to
          suit the specific needs of your courses.

          Starter packs help your students get started in seconds. They are
          fully templated projects with source code, pre-installed languages,
          databases and any other components. So you can instantly create
          projects which are ready to edit, compile and run.

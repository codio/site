## <a name="Quotas"></a>Quota &amp; Limits

Codio does not currently have any limits on storage, bandwidth or API usage. We reserve the right to introduce these in the future and once we have a better understanding of usage, we will introduce them. However, when we announce such limits ...

- we will notify you at least 15 days before the limits are imposed
- such limits will be imposed to catch heavy load situations or where very large amounts of content has been uploaded (videos, very large numbers of images, large binary files etc.)
- quotas will not apply to application development but rather to deployment of applications that generate heavy load to Codio's servers

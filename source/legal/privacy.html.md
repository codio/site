###3. Use of Information Collected 

3.1 Users in Education Institutions

Codio does not use student data for marketing purposes whilst a student is a member of an education institution that holds an institution license to use the Codio Products.
Codio will only communicate with student users where their use of Codio is associated with a valid education institution license, and only in the following instances:
<ol class='roman'><li>where a student user makes use of “contact us” in the product; if the content of a student-initiated communication using “contact us” relates to operational use of the Codio product, Codio customer support will respond; in all other instances, Codio will refer the student user to the organization owner or faculty member or teacher leading the relevant class;</li>
<li>where a student is a member of a “self-pay” education institution organization, and the student raises a billing enquiry, Codio customer support will respond directly to the student user;</li>
<li>where a student ceases to be a member of an education institution organization in Codio, e.g. where the student leaves the institution or is no longer required to have access to the institution account in Codio, we will communicate with these users to offer them options for continuing their use of Codio, and to explain options for downloading, storing or saving their content;</li>
<li>where important changes are released into the Product, we will communicate these changes to all users including students, at a minimum via a notification inside the Product and potentially also by email.</li></ol>      
All Other Users

###4. Web Site Navigational Information 

Codio uses commonly used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web site (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company’s Web site and how this information may be used.

4.1 Cookies - Codio uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Codio servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Codio, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” web form), you remain anonymous to the Company. Codio uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. 
If you have chosen to identify yourself to Codio, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Products, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Products and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Products. 
Codio uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Web site. When you purchase the Products or provide us with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that we place on your Web browser. Codio is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate our Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Products. 
Codio may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Codio customers to provide you with information about Codio and the Products – subject to certain exclusions including those set out in 3.1 above relating to student data.

Codio uses Web beacons to operate and improve our Web site and email communications.

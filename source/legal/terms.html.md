These Terms govern your access to and use of Codio software, products, and/or services (individually or collectively, the “Products”) and any information, content, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded, purchased, licensed or appearing on or through the Products (collectively referred to as “Content”).

###1. Basic terms and accounts
Your access to and/or use of the Products and/or the Content constitutes your acceptance of these Terms. You are responsible for your use of the Products and/or the Content in accordance with these Terms and with any applicable laws, rules and regulations to which you are subject

For students in education institutions your access to and/or use of the Products constitutes your consent, or your relevant parental or guardian’s consent to the terms relating to privacy and use of personal information.  Your education institution may separately require you to confirm acceptance of privacy and related provisions established by the institution reqarding your use of technology products.

Your account with Codio or your education institution’s or legal entity’s account with Codio gives you access to the relevant Product and/or Content with such services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.

We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users including the following. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Products and/or Content on behalf of a company, university, school, institution or legal entity then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. You may use the Products and/or Content only in compliance with these Terms, along with any applicable agreement entered into by your institution with Codio relating to the Products and/or Content, and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.

In cases where you have authorized or registered another individual, including a minor, to use your account(s), you are fully responsible for (i) the online conduct of such User; (ii) controlling the User’s access to and use of the Products and/or Content; (iii) the consequences of any misuse by such User and (iv) ensuring that such User abides by all the Terms as regards that User’s use of the Product and/or the Content as if that User’s access and use of the Product and/or Content is you. Codio requires that the parents, guardian, or other authorized adult of a minor under 18 years of age as defined under United States statute or under 18 in the EU (and under 16 in the EU effective from May 25th 2018 following the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation) affirmatively consent to the use of a Codio Product/Content by such minor. Codio reserves the right to provide access to the minor’s account to the minor’s parents, guardian or other authorized adult, upon such adult’s request. Please see our Section 2 of these Terms.

###2. Privacy and use of personal information
2.1 Education Institutions and their Students:

Codio recognizes the importance of safeguarding and protecting data relating to education institutions using Codio who in many cases will register their students for Codio accounts (“education institutions”), and to students whose information we may receive from themselves or from their education institution (“students”).  As we set out below, education institutions determine how we receive student data contingent on the license arrangement they contract for with Codio.  These privacy and use of personal information terms relate to your use of the Codio platform and set out the approach we take to protect your data.

For our privacy policy relating to the codio web site (https://codio.com) see our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy).

2.2 How we collect and use information:

2.2.1 Information about Education Institutions: we ask for certain information when an education institution administrator, faculty member or other staff member creates an education trial account with Codio, including a name, institution name, institution type, email address and password.  We may also retain information when an education institution sends us a message via our website or through our platform “contact us” application, or by responding to emails.  When an education institution starts using the Codio product, we will keep a record of the institution user group’s use of the product. We use this information to support, maintain and continuously improve the product and the service we offer our users, to analyze our service offering, and to communicate with education institutions.

2.2.2 Student data: Codio may receive personally identifiable information about students (“student data”) in the course of providing our products to education institutions.  Codio regards student data as confidential and Codio does not ever use student data for any purpose other than to provide the products.  Student data may include personal identifiable information and data that can be considered “educational records” (records such as project work or assessment scores that contain information directly related to a student) generated by your use of the Codio product.  Codio does not require or request that any educational records be provided to Codio by the institution or by any individual user.

If a student user of the products contacts us directly, we may retain the content of that communication but will as a matter of course direct the student to the faculty/admin or other named user responsible for managing the education institution’s account with Codio.

In many instances, students in education institutions will access the Codio products by account creation initiated by the education institution, or alternatively by account creation initiated individually by the student.  In either case, the education institution confirms it has the appropriate consents of the students or the parents before the student accesses the Codio products.


2.3 How your information is shared:

Codio does not and never will rent, sell, or otherwise provide your data to any third party for marketing purposes, nor do we ever engage in marketing of the Codio products directly to students of our education institution customers.  We may from time to time send all users including student users important news about product changes that affect their experience of using the Codio products, or about how to manage their accounts after they cease to be part of an education institution user group.

We may also share information with third parties (e.g. analytics services) but only for the purposes of monitoring and managing the provision of the Codio products.  We may also be obliged to share information with law enforcement when compelled to do so, or to enforce our acceptable usage policy, or to protect other users of the Codio products. In the event of a request by law enforcement agencies to obtain information, we will a) notify you within 24 hours of the receipt of such a request, and b) give you the opportunity to engage with the law enforcement agencies to determine whether you wish to seek a protective order.

In the event of any change of control of Codio, if the ownership of Codio changes or transfers, we will only transfer personally identifiable information if we receive written assurances that the new owner intends to operate Codio as a going concern with a contractual obligation to adopt an approach to privacy and data protection as rigorous as our current approach and policies. In the event of a change of control, we will notify all customer institutions and offer the option of an opt-out of the transfer of personally identifiable information.

Sharing of student data: Codio may facilitate the sharing of student data with third parties but only when instructed and enabled to do so by the education institution, e.g. with a third party learning management system provider.  Please note, these privacy and use of personal information terms relate only to the Codio products.

Where a US institution licensing Codio for use by the institution and its student group shares personally identifiable information or any other data about a student or group of students, the institution effectively designates Codio “an agent of the institution” for the purposes of FERPA.  For the avoidance of doubt, student data that could be considered educational records, as defined by FERPA, may be generated by your use of the product.

With respect to EU institutions, Codio adheres to the practices and provisions of the current EU Data protection directive 95/46/EC and will comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) from May 25th 2018.

As between Codio and you, you own all right, title and interest to all Student Data you provide or otherwise make available to us.

In either instance – an institution or a student sharing personally identifiable information - Codio does not own, control, or license such Student Data, except so as to provide the Products and/or Content as described herein.


2.4 Use of Codio by organizations and individuals outside of Education

Any information that you provide, have provided or may provide to Codio and any information which may be collected by us in connection with your use of the Products and/or the Content, including first name, last name, email address, and any other information including personal information (“Your Information”), will be collected, maintained and used by us in order to provide the Products and/or Content to you or your institution, or in accordance with these Terms, our privacy policy located at “[Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)”, any additional terms applicable to an individual Product and/or Content, and any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Product and/or Content. You understand that, through your use of the Products and/or Content, you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in these Terms, the [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) and any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Product and/or Content) of Your Information, including the transfer of Your Information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, hosting, processing, and use by Codio.

By accessing or using the Products and/or the Content, you hereby consent that Codio may (i) use any or all of Your Information in connection or combination with other Codio Products and/or Content to provide, maintain, protect and improve Products and/or Content and to develop new Products and/or Content and (ii) provide any or all of Your Information to third parties that provide certain functions and other services for Codio or marketing in connection with the Products and/or Content, including without limitation the entity hosting or licensing the Products. We will never share your information with third parties for any purpose other than the marketing of Codio Products and/or Content.

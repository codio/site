**Effective August 7th, 2013.**

The following guidelines apply to the use of all Codio Marks licensed pursuant to the Terms:

**1.** You must use the appropriate legend for the Mark: ® for registered trademarks, TM for unregistered trademarks, and SM for unregistered service marks.

**2.** You shall not use any Codio Mark to disparage Codio, its products or services, or in a manner which, in Codio's reasonable judgment, may diminish or damage its goodwill in the Mark or imply endorsement by Codio. You agree to cease all such uses upon written notification by Codio. You agree not to take any action which might lead a third party to think a Codio Mark is owned by you, or which might adversely impact Codio's reputation. You shall at all times use the Codio Marks in a manner consistent with trademark laws.

**3.** You shall notify Codio immediately of any improper, infringing, confusing or unauthorized use of Codio Marks of which you become aware.

**4.** You shall not alter the appearance of any Codio Mark or obscure such Mark in any way. Changing the color, font, or proportions of any Codio Mark is prohibited.

**5.** Questions concerning proper use of Codio shall be directed to support@codio.com.

      <h3>Licences explained</h3>
      <h4>Individuals</h4>
      <p>
        Our individuals Developer licences are offered on a monthly
        subscription basis and priced in either US dollars or UK
        pounds. You can set up a recurring monthly payment and manage your
        account and billing details inside Codio.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you cancel at any time, your account runs to the end of the
        last paid licence period at which point your account and projects
        will be de-activated but not deleted. You can export or save
        your projects to a repository &mdash; and you can re-activate your
        account at any time.
      </p>
      <h4>Schools and universities</h4>
      <p>
        Schools and university licences are offered as academic year
        licences for a defined user group &mdash; teachers, lecturers, students
        and technicians &mdash; for each education institution. Licences are
        invoiced annually and paid for in advance of a licence period.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pricing-faq-entry">
      <h3>School and university organisations</h3>
      <p>
        School and university user groups benefit from Codio's
        organization management tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can create you school or university organization with all your
        teaching staff, faculty members and students assigned to your organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Codio offers powerful Class management functionality &mdash; allowing you
        to create Class groups comprising teachers, students and any course modules
        or units you wish to assign to a Class &mdash; whether these are Codio
        learning resources or resources or projects you create.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer easy on-boarding features for education organization user
        groups, and on licence renewal, we'll work with you to manage on-boarding
        or roll-off of existing students to ensure a smooth transition for
        students starting or ending courses.

      <h3>Account owners</h3>
      <p>
        Typically the account holder is the teacher or lecturer, or other
        department member who creates your institutions organization in Codio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple owners can be assigned to any organization &mdash; e.g. multiple

        and assign resources.

      <h3>Teacher accounts vs student accounts</h3>
      <p>
        Teachers and faculty members have access to a teacher-view dashboard
        which presents information different from the information presented to
        any student user in your group.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teacher view shows you organization members, Class groups, teachers,
        students and any course resources assigned to a Class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once auto-marked assessments are live, you'll also see a rich dashboard of
        information about student engagement and progress &mdash; viewable in whole
        class, individual student or individual question topic formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read more in our documentation about school set up, organizations
        and class features.

          <h2>Easy to Adopt</h2>
          <p>
            Codio is easy for faculty to adopt without disruption to existing teaching practices.
            The benefits however are immediate in reduced setup and admin time, easier faculty-student
            interaction and richer insight into student performance. Getting started is simple too - you
            can set up instructor and student groups in seconds and integrate with your LMS in a blink.

          <h2>Robust learning platform</h2>
          <p>
            When adopting platform technology to support new programs - you need the reassurance of
            a partner that has a proven ability to support students and faculty at scale. From tens
            of thousands of students on edX to multi-institution higher education campus programs,
            Codio’s massively scalable cloud infrastructure is built for volume.

          <h2>A platform students will actually use</h2>
          <p>
            Students often feel intimidated by technology that was never designed to support a
            learning experience.  That’s doubly true for students grasping the vital skills core to
            computer science. Codio is different, with design driven by faculty and students to be
            approachable, feedback-rich and better for student engagement.

        <h2>Funding Magnet</h2>
        <p>
          Often new STEM and CS programs are a catalyst for institutional innovation, student
          employability and the attraction of new funds to stimulate and capture enrolment growth.
          Codio can strengthen the case for program funds and show you how to maximize your impact.
